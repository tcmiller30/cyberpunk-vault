## Greeting the Client
When the players show up to his house
>The Client lives in a very exclusive conapt in the Upper Marina. The place reeks of sophistication and money; it was built out of a reconstructed set of law offices from before the War; wrought iron railings, an open glass elevator in the style of a 1900s hotel. As you step into the tiled and wood-paneled lobby, sharp eyed security Solos watch you closely. When you come up to the apartment call display and punch in the access code on the chip Rogue gave you, the response is almost immediate. 
>
>A young man’s voice, sounds about late twenties to early thirties, answers. He says nervously, “I’ll unlock the elevator; you can come up.” As you head to the lift, your feet making way too much noise in the quiet lobby, the door opens and the glass and iron box lifts you up five stories to a series of wood-paneled apartment doors. Apartment #554 opens as you approach, and a face peers out. 
>
"Are you the people Ms Ammerdiaries sent? Thank you for coming so soon, please come in."
>
>The apartment has an open view over the new Harbor Canal, all the way over to where the construction drones are raising the scaffolding on the Watson megabuilding. The afternoon light streams through the glass, revealing a tasteful, open concept multilevel apartment with very expensive, modern style furnishings. There are a few books scattered around; mostly tech journals and the equivalent of catalogs for exclusive goods—the fact that they’re actually on paper instead of just dumped to a datapad from the Data Pool should tell you something.
>
>He sits down on a very expensive, real leather sofa and gestures for you all to join him on the chairs surrounding the glass tabletop. He spreads his hands and launches into a nervous conversation.
>
>"As I'm sure you've been told, a few days ago I took my girlfriend Aisha to La Lune Bleu; it's really exquisite french restaurant, very exclusive, if you ever get the chance to go you *must* try the Salad Niçoise. Well, I stepped away from the table to use the restroom, and when I returned, she was gone.
>
>I really need your help. This is something I can’t even involve Ziggurat in. It’s too… personal. Someone has kidnapped my fiancée, Ai. I don’t know why, and I don’t know who. I thought it might be a corporate extraction, but Ai isn’t working on anything important; she’s just handling basic administrative stuff; technical cleanup and the like. I mean, why would anyone want to extract her?
>
>“It must be personal. Although for the life of me I can’t think who would hate me like this. I’m not that important in Ziggurat; I do system design, but nothing that isn’t done by anyone else in my division. All I know is, I have to get Ai back. I’ll pay anything the kidnappers want, but when I put a call out on the Data Pool, Ms. Ammerdiaries contacted me and said your group would be able to—to rescue Ai.”

## The Phone Call
**At some point during the conversation with Kodai, his Agent pings. He is getting a call from Ai's Agent.**

>“(gasp) Is this Kody? Please, let this be Kody! It’s Ai! I really need you! I really need you! I’ve been kidnapped and I don’t know where I am! They just scooped me up and put a bag over me when I was in the restaurant! I don’t know what they want! I’m locked in a room! They didn’t notice your Agent has an autodial to your work Agent—I’m calling you before they figure out what I’m doing! Help me, Kody! Find me, please! Save me! I need you!”
>
>"I don't know where I'm being held, but I need you to come I rescue me fast before--"

**Her voice is cut short by a rough male voice that orders her to shut up.**
*DV17 Human Perception Check reveals his demand sounds almost like a plea, like he's frustrated rather than being intimidating.*

Hearing the kidnapper's voice on the holo, Kodai desperately says:
>"Please, I'll give you anything you want, just give me back my Ai. I'm begging you!"

Surprisingly, the kidnapper responds with silence, instead, the mystery person on the other line hangs up. Any attempts to call Ai are rejected, although she may call the players throughout the mission.

## Signs of Ai
### Camera Records
Hacking into the Conapt's Camera Records grants access to the last week of camera footage. Since the kidnapping, Kodai can be seen sulking and pacing around his house. The footage before the date of the kidnapping shows Kodai living a peaceful, happy life...entirely alone.

Kodai acts like he's living with another person, even going so far as to pantomime cuddling in bed or set out meals for her (which he later packages up and stores in his fridge)
### Master Bedroom
The closet in the bedroom contains some clothing, jewelry, and small trinkets that seem to have belonged to Ai.
- **DV13 Perception-** The crew notices these items are coated with a fine layer of dust, as though they haven't been touched in quite some time.
- **DV13 Wardrobe and Style**- The clothes and jewelry are at least a decade out of fashion.
### Kitchen
The Crew finds evidence of Kodai eating meals with Ai. There are receipts from local restaurants with reservations for two, enough place settings and dishes for two people, and refrigerator shelves stocked with leftover containers labeled "Ai's Leftovers--Don't Touch". Some of the leftovers look to have been left in the fridge for weeks.
### Bathrooms
There's evidence of a couple sharing a bathroom. Toothbrushes, make up, shampoo, feminine hygiene products. On closer inspection, one of the toothbrushes has never been used, the bottle of Fragrant Essence shampoo is unopened as well as the makeup and hygiene products
### Office
Kodai's dataterm is here, surrounded by photos of Ai taken at various fancy locales around Night City. In each photo, she is smiling, winking, laughing, or otherwise making a face at Kodai, who's obviously taking the picture.

The data terminal can be accessed with a DV13 Electronics/Security Check (Password: "Ai"). They find an inbox with a staggering number of emails and meeting requests from other Execs at Ziggurat. It's clear that his work attendance has been less than stellar.
