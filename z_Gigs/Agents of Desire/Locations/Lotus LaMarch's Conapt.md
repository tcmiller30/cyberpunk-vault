## Coming Up to the Conapt
When the Crew arrives at Lotus LaMarch’s conapt, they find it thoroughly locked down. The windows are shuttered and the door is locked up tight. They can attempt to break the lock with a DV 21 Electronics/ Security Tech Check but it would be easier and more polite to use the call button.

If the Crew breaks in, they find Lotus LaMarch at a work table in the main room. He starts to deploy a popup gun but stops when he sees that he’s outnumbered. Any DV to convince Lotus to work with the Crew will be 2 points higher.

If the Crew uses the call button, they hear the weary voice of Lotus LaMarch on the other end.
>**"Enibadi yu bi, yu av di rang adres. Mi no humor solicitors an mi nuh do giveaways."**
>(*Whoever, you are, you have the wrong address. I don't humor solicitors, and I don't do giveaways.*)

If the Crew tells LaMarch they are there investigating the disappearance of Ai, he says:
>**"Mi nuh interested inna get involve inna a missing persons case, man. Guh wey. Now"**
>(*I'm not interested in getting involved in a missing persons case, man. Go Away. Now*)

With a DV 13 Human Perception Check, the Crew can tell that he has some involvement already. If the Crew succeeds at a DV 15 Persuasion Check they can convince him to talk to them through the screen on the door panel. The screen lights up, and shows Lotus LaMarch, sitting at a worktable, tinkering with a cyberhand and not really looking at the screen.
## Speaking to LaMarch
Lotus LaMarch is a guarded man with a great deal of pride in his work. He gives short, clipped answers while aiming to never give away more information than he needs to and never making eye contact.

He gets irritated if he is compared to a street tech.
>**"Mi a nuh street tech yuh scop-brained idiot. Mi a one elite technologist. Mi work wid di most powerful corporations inna Night City. Mi a much more dan some back alley ripper."**
>(*I'm not a street tech you scop-brained idiot. I'm an elite technologist. I have worked with the most powerful corporations in Night City. I'm much more than some back alley ripper.*)

**DV 17 Persuasion / DV 15 Conversation Check Convinces Lotus to spill what he knows about Kodai and Ai's relationship and her disappearance. If the crew mentions Ai's obituary, no Check is needed to get him to talk.**

### The Tragedy of Ai
He sighs heavily and puts down the cyberhand, looking up at the screen for the first time. You can see the tired in his eyes.
>**"Mi did work wid Kodai Khan but not a mi own free will. Di man is insane. Him... well, him blackmail mi. Threaten fi ruin mi if mi neva help him mek sure him fiancée neva lef him. Wi all have secrets weh we woulda radda not see fall inna di wrong hands, an mi neva tink him did gone as far as him did deh... Him bring him fiancée to mi workshop, druged up an barely conscious, although him did try fi convince mi seh she did a boutta."**

>(*I did work with Kodai Khan but not of my own free will. The man is insane. He... well, he blackmailed me. Threatened to ruin me if I didn’t help him make sure his fiancée never left him. We all have secrets we’d rather not see fall into the wrong hands, and I didn’t think he was as far gone as he was... He brought his fiancée to my workshop, drugged up and barely conscious, although he tried to convince me she was dying. *)

>**Him tell mi fi strap har dung an jack har inna mi Architecture. Mi did tink him... Mi nuh really know weh mi did tink... Him mek mi run a program inna mi NET: Soulkiller. Unu afi andastan! Mi neva have a pick in di matta. Nobadi nuh wake up inna di morning an decide fi kill some woman an cram har consciousness inna one AI. But a dat him mek mi do"**
>
>(*He told me to strap her down and jack her into my Architecture. I thought he... I don’t really know what I thought... He had me run a program in my NET: Soulkiller. You have to understand! I didn’t have a choice. No one wakes up in the morning and decides to kill some woman and cram her consciousness into an AI. But. But that’s what he made me do. *)

>**Mi rewire him agent an load har engram onto it. Augmented him optics an him cyberaudio so him coulda see an hear a manifestation a har Engram. Im seh a ongl til im did a go out imself. Im seh im a go come back fi mek mi run Soulkiller pan im. So dem coulda deh tugeda fi eva inna di NET.**
>
>(*I rewired his agent and loaded her engram onto it. Augmented his optics and his cyberaudio so he could see and hear a manifestation of her Engram. He said it was only until he was going out himself. He said he’d come back to have me run Soulkiller on him. So they could be together forever in the NET.*)

>**"But dat was many years ago. Him contact mi since den, fi technical work. Upgrade him Agent an such. Him look like him tink... Him look like him tink Ai still alive. A like him totally forget weh him did do.**
>
>(*But that was many years ago. He's contacted me since then, for technical work. Upgrading his Agent and such. He seems to think... He seems to think Ai is still alive. It's like he's totally forgotten what he did.*)

>**Mi neva have no choice. Mi a ex-Arasaka. Mi have plenty a enemies fram mi past weh woulda love fi find mi, an di man threaten fi gi mi location to all a dem.**
>
>(*I didn't have a choice. I'm ex-Arasaka. I have plenty of enemies from my past who would love to find me, and the man threatened to give my location to all of them.*)

>**"Mi destroy di copy a Soulkiller afta mi use it, an mi a try fi foget dat deh deh ever since den. Mi a haunt by mi past, a wait fi di wrong person come call, a nuh punishment enough? Weh els a man haffi do."**
>
>(*I destroyed the copy of Soulkiller after I used it, and have been trying to forget that day ever since. I am haunted by my past, waiting for the wrong person to come calling, is that not punishment enough? What else does a man have to do.*)
