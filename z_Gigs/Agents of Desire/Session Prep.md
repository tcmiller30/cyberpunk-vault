## Session 2
### Finishing the Netrun
So far, Bluescreen has not accessed the Observation Cameras. Reaching that floor, with a DV6 Control Check, he will gain access to the past week's security footage, including the night of the kidnapping.

Scrolling back, they an pinpoint Kodai sitting at a table on the second floor but they don’t see Ai. If they scroll all the way back to when Kodai and Ai entered the restaurant, they see Kodai being led to the table and obviously interacting with Ai, but they don’t see her. As they watch the night progress, Kodai chats with Ai, laughs, and has the waiter bring two glasses of wine for the pair of them, but Ai is never visible. Part way through the night, Kodai excuses himself and gets up, leaving his phone on the table and heading to the bathroom. Moments later, a waiter slips by the table and smoothly pockets Kodai’s phone as he takes away a basket of bread. When Kodai returns, he looks around, growing increasingly concerned. He speaks to a busboy and begins panicking, heading for the door.
> Bluescreen would know that it would be possible for a skilled Netrunner to code a Virus to alter the video and remove evidence of the kidnapping. Alternatively, at a high-end establishment like La Lune Bleu, some patrons might not always want people knowing they're there, whether for a secret business meeting, affair, murder plots, etc.
> 
> A DV6 Pathfinder Check reveals no evidence of tampering in the system
#### An Interruption
At some point, the emergency exit opens up and a young woman in her early 20's steps out. She has short black hair with green highlights pulled back into a messy bun. If the players are startled, she says "relax chooms, I don't get paid enough to give a fuck what you're doing out here, I just came out for a smoke. Some rockerboy just set up shop on a table crooning about his sexual awakening. You wouldn't happen to know the guy would you? Nah I'm just kidding, again, I don't care. You got a light?"

This is Jane Gatsby, she is a member of the High Class Heist Crew and has suspected there was something strange afoot when Thorne started to play. She went to check around the NET Access Point and confirmed her suspicions. She will snap a photo with her Cybereye and send it over to Kevin Dickens, with the knowledge that there is a team investigating the theft/kidnapping.
### Call From Rogue
After leaving La Lune Bleu, they get a call from Rogue.
>"Where are you gonks? I just got a call from the Client. 'Says he still hasn't heard from you. Pro tip for you greens: usually when a fixer hands you a datashard with the client's realspace on it, they mean for you to go to the coordinates."
> 
> "Lucky for you, I have a driver sent to pick you up. He owes me a favor so he'll be playing wheelman while you finish off your biz. The Client said he had to delta to a work meeting, so he won't be there when you arrive. What you choose to do once you get to his digs is up to you. Wait for him to get back, poke around the place and see if you can find some info, I don't give a shit, just remember there are eddies on the line."

### Going to Kodai's
Players will have two choices:
- Wait for Kodai to Return from his Business
- Snoop around Kodai's house to look for clues
#### Waiting for Kodai
After 30 minutes of waiting, members of the Saturday Night Buttkickers approach them, brandishing weapons. They recognize the Crew based off information supplied to Kevin Dickens by Jane Gatsby from La Lune Bleu.

> One of the boostergangers speaks up, "We just came here to check the corporat's pad for some more loot, but seeing you here, I guess we get the pleasure of teaching a bunch of gonks some rules of the streets: this is our mark, next time, find your own. Class is now in session assholes." And he draws iron.
> 
> Roll [[Combat#Initiative|Initiative]]

After combat, Refer to the **Buttkicker Information** section of the pdf.
#### Breaking and Entering
With a DV15 Pick Lock Check, the players can break into Kodai's Conapt to look for clues.

> Roll a Group LUCK Check to see if Kodai has already cleared the Crew's ids within his conapt.
> DV10 LUCK, 1 person from the crew rolls but every member can pitch in as many LUCK points as they'd like.
> 
> If Successful: ID Signatures are recognized by conapt defenses, no need to disable them
> If Failed: ID's are not recognized and must be disabled through hack, tampering, or combat.

Once Crew begins to search apartment, they may discover [[Kodai Khan's Home#Signs of Ai|Signs of Ai]].

After 30 minutes, the Buttkickers break the door down with the intention of robbing the home. Seeing the Crew, they initiate combat.

#### After the Combat
Once the Buttkickers have been dealt with, Kodai Khan will appear in the aftermath, shocked at the scene occurring at his home. He is shaken and won't be of much help unless calmed down with either a **DV18 Persuasion** or **DV13 Medical** Check. Otherwise he won't be much help, but he will receive a phone call from Ai, who may be of more use to the Crew.

### After Kodai's
After dealing with Kodai and the Buttkickers, the Crew can try to find more information on Ai using a corner Dataterm or searching on their agents. **DV24 Library Search** can have them reverse image search Ai's photo, discovering an obituary from 17 years ago. Ai's body was found in a dump site in the Hot Zone, her cerebral systems and neuralware burnt out.
