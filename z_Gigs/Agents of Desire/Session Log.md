### The Scene of the Crime
- Crew travels to La Lune Bleu
- Thorne tries getting access to restaurant by claiming he and Sura are scheduled to perform at the venue as the group "Mousecunt", despite the fact the restaurant has no stage for live entertainment.

				- *The number is disconnected*
		- Engaged in Cyber-combat with the Imp
	- Maven kept watch during the Netrun

			- Man spiraled into a paranoid panic, hopped the fence, dropped to the docks, and jumped in the marina, swimming away
-  Mousecunt's performance went fairly well considering the circumstances. An older man from Heywood dining in the back was a fan of Thorne's and reacted positively to the improptu gig. The high-society patrons politely nodded their heads to Thorne's head-banging guitar solo and Sura's enthusiastic stomping.
	- The maitre d' came back with security after hearing the commotion, but allowed Mousecunt to finish their performance of *Getting Finger Blasted in the Walk-In Freezer of a Bahama Breeze* after noticing the crowd's non-negative reaction

- A waitress, Jane Gatsby, exits the restaurant for a smoke break. She seemed to have taken a couple of photos using a cybereye.
	- Maven called her out, but she claimed she took photos of anyone strange she interacts with in case harm were to befall her.
	- Jane asked if she and Bluescreen were with Thorne and Sura, but then waved it off jokingly. She then retreated back inside

	- Snitch Rich picks them up in a heavily modified, scrap-heap of a technical truck
- The crew hops in Snitch Rich's Rig and makes their way to Watson and the Hanging Gardens
### Kodai's Conapt
- Arriving on scene, they are told that Kodai has authorized their presence and they will be permitted on the premises.
- The crew decided to snoop around Kodai's conapt to look for some clues before he returned
- Hacking into the conapt's Net Architecture, Bluescreen accessed the camera records and found security footage of Kodai living seemingly happily by himself before the day of the kidnapping, although he behaved as though he was living with someone else.
- Kodai's office terminal was filled with unread emails and meeting requests.
- There was evidence of a shared living space in the bathrooms, the bedroom, and the kitchen, with extra toothbrushes and soaps, clothes and personal effects, and meals and place settings. Everything that seemed to belong to Ai appeared to have been left untouched for a significant amount of time.
- Maven found old employee badges from Arasaka's Psycho-Cybernetics Research Division belonging to the Kodai and Ai and a business card for Lotus LaMarch, Cybertech.
### The Break-In

- Bluescreen hacked the conapt's sound system to broadcast his voice and demand the gangers stand down
- Thorne chased Steve to the utility closet where he beat him within an inch of his life
- Maven jumped down the stairs and dispatched the other ganger that was in the utility room with Thorne and Steve.
- The other two fell into the marina below
	- One after Sura unloaded an autofire burst with her smart weapon on a ganger who had taken cover behind a wall on the balcony
	- The other after Snitch Rich picked up, overhead pressed, and ejected him out the window.
### The Aftermath
- The crew interrogated Steve, who admitted that he was part of a gang called the Saturday Night Buttkickers, who were hired by Kevin Dickens to go rob Kodai's apartment with the hopes that he would have more valuable objects in his home.
- He wasn't expecting to be met with much resistance at all, let alone a fully armed crew of mercs.
### Kodai Returns
- As you were interrogating Steve, Kodai returned home to find the chaos that had unfolded in his apartment. But you were able to calm him down a bit, convincing him that you had prevented further damage to his conapt after the boostergangers had violently broken in.
- Kodai talked about the night of the kidnapping, pausing to recommend the Salad Nicoise should the crew ever return to La Lune Bleu
- He seemed miffed that Thorne had poked around at Ai's rotting meals in the fridge after it was brought up.
