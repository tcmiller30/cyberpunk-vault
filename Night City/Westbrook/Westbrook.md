The Westbrook District of Night City is home to many wealthy elites, celebrities, and corporates. It is also the home to Japantown, an especially important part of Night Cuty for two reasons. The first being that it's the cultural center for the city's sizable Japanes community. The second is that it is the home base for most of the Yakuza families operating throughout Northern California: it's centrally located, has limited police interference, and outsiders tend to stick out like a sore thumb. The Tyger Claws are the dominant gang in the district and are considered its rulers, though only at night, in order to avoid the presence of heavy corporate security.
