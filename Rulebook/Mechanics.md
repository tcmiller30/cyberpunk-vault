## Movement
There are **3 Scales of Movement** used in Cyberpunk RED.
### Narrative Movement
Movement described in real-world terms as part of the narrative of a story. For example, cars move at miles per hour, walking is measured in similar, but smaller, distances.

| Travel Method | MPH |
| ------------- | --- |
| Walking       | 2.5 |
| Running       | 5   |

### Figurative Movement
Comparing one MOVE STAT to another MOVE STAT to see which is faster overall. This is best used for simple sustained speed contests, like the outcome of a foot or drag race. This is where you compare the Lamborghini to the Volkswagen; one has a higher MOVE STAT than the other, and this is used as a basis of comparison.
### Literal Movement
A measurement of actual distance, used in combat and when using miniatures. This rule is explained [[Mechanics#Move Action|later]] in this section.

## Time and Initiative
Cyberpunk RED uses two ways of measuring time. The first, **Roleplaying Time,** works just like it does in real life. The second, **Combat Time**, is far more exacting. Combat Time is divided into **Turns**, each of which takes approximately 3 seconds. The amount of time it takes each entity involved in the combat to take a Turn is a **Round**. Because Actions happen roughly simultaneously in game, one Round is also approximately 3 seconds long.



# On Your Turn

>[!info]- **Your Turn = 1 Move Action + 1 Action**

## Actions
### Move Action
Every turn, a Character gets a Move Action, which can only be used to move a number of m/yds equal to their MOVE x 2, or a number of squares equal to their MOVE, which can include moving diagonally.
### Attack
Use an Action to make an attack with Ranged Combat or Melee Combat
### Get Into a Vehicle
Use an Action to get into an unlocked vehicle or a vehicle you have the physical/biometric key for.
### Get Up
Use an Action to get up from being on the floor (aka Prone). While Prone you cannot use a Move Action until you first use this Action.
### Grab
Grab or hold someone, take an object they are carrying, or escape a grapple.
### Hold Action
In combat, a Character can use this Action to Hold off on one specific Action until a designated number in the Initiative Queue comes up, or a specified event occurs. When that time comes, they can choose to either go through with their chosen Action or forgo it entirely. You can’t Hold an Action across multiple Rounds. You can’t change your mind about when the action triggers, either. Move Actions and NET Actions cannot be Held at all.
### Run
Use an Action to take an additional Move Action. If you can't use a Move Action right now, you can't use this Action.
### Stabalize
Use an Action to stabilize a target to begin the natural healing process or pull them out of the Mortally Wounded Wound State to save their life.
### Starting a Vehicle
Use an Action to start a vehicle that you are already in. This requires the physical/biometric key for the vehicle.
### Throw
Throw a person you are grappling or an object you are holding.
### Use NET Actions
Use an Action to make multiple NET Action such as running Programs. Only a Netrunner can make use of NET Actions, which they can take instead of another Action on their Turn.
### Use a Skill
Use an Action to use one of your Skills to attempt to accomplish a quick task (3 seconds max). If the GM determines your proposed task would take more than 3 seconds, and you still want to do it, you can spend your Action every Turn to attempt to accomplish it, at a rate of 3 seconds per Turn, making your Check only when you've finished the duration of the task. Task resolution is covered in Resolving Actions with Skills later on this page.
### Use an Object
Use this Action as a catch-all for using/manipulating/ picking up an object in ways that wouldn't require using a Skill and aren't covered by other Actions, but would still require a quick 3 seconds of effort. Use this for things like opening up a door, switching your held shotgun out for an assault rifle slung on your back, picking up an unattended weapon off the floor, pressing the button on a detonator, or biting into a slice of pizza. If the GM determines your proposed task would take more than 3 seconds, and you still want to do it, you can spend your Action every Turn to attempt to accomplish it, at a rate of 3 seconds per Turn. Drawing an easily accessible weapon isn't an Action if you have a free hand.
# Skill Checks
A Skill is something your Character knows how to do thanks to their training. The level of your Skill represents how trained your Character is in that activity. Each skill is linked to a STAT that represents natural ability. A skill check is made by rolling a d10 and adding it to your **Skill Base**
>[!info] **Skill Base = STAT + Skill**
## Resolving Skill Checks
**There are two ways to resolve skill checks:**
### Skill Contest
You resolve your Skill against another living thing or person's Skill (like trying to persuade someone to do something for you). To do this, both you, *The Attacker*, and your opponent, *The Defender*, will **Roll 1d10 + Your Skill Base**

>[!info]- **Skill Contest = Attacker's Skill Base + 1d10 vs. Defender's Skill Base + 1d10**

***In case of a tie, the Defender always wins***
### Skill Threshold
Resolve your Skill against the difficulty of a situation (like picking a lock or driving a car). The GM determines how long the task you want to perform will take and uses the table below to decide which rating best describes the difficulty to perform the task, the **Difficulty Value (DV)**. You then add **Your Skill Base + 1d10** and try to beat the DV assigned by the GM
### Difficulty Values

| Difficulty       | Description                                                                                                                                                   | DV     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Simple           | This is something most people can do without thinking, but which might be hard for a small child                                                              | 9      |
| Everyday         | This feat is something most people can do without special training                                                                                            | 13     |
| Difficult        | This feat is difficult to accomplish without training or a natural talent                                                                                     | 15     |
| <br>Professional | This feat takes actual training and the user can be considered to be a professional, skilled in their abilities                                               | <br>17 |
| <br>Heroic       | This is a highlyh skilled feat; one that only the best of the best can pull off. This is the level of sports stars and other highly regarded superstars.      | <br>21 |
| <br>Incredible   | This is a tremendous feat. Pulling this off would rate you among the very best of your class professionally. You are of truly Olympian mettle.                | <br>24 |
| <br>Legendary    | An awe-inspiring feat. This is something people write stories about; a truly amazing accomplishment that will be spokenn of in hushed tones for years to come | <br>29 |
### Critical Success
When you roll a natural 10 on your d10, you've scored a Critical Success. Roll another 1d10 and add the result to your first roll. If you roll another 10, you do not score another Critical Success.
### Critical Failure
When you roll a natural roll of 1 on your d10, you've scored a Critical Failure. Roll another 1d10 and sub- tract the result from your STAT + Skill + the first roll. If you roll another 1, you do not score another Critical Failure.

>[!info]- Despite the name, a highly skilled Character can actually succeed after a Critical Failure and a high DV can still defeat a Character who achieves a Critical Success.
### Modifying the Attempt
Sometimes conditions beyond your control may make it harder to perform a task. For example, a Simple (DV9) Skill Check is a whole order of magnitude tougher during an earthquake. These external condi- tions are called Modifiers. When the GM decides a Modifier applies to your Skill Check, you will subtract the Modifier Value from your roll. If multiple modifiers would be present, their effects would be cumulative.
#### Negative Modifier Examples

| Condition                            | Mod Value |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Night or low lighting conditions     | -1        |
| Have never done this before          | -1        |
| Complex Task                         | -2        |
| Don't Have the Proper Tools          | -2        |
| Slept Uncomfortable the Night Before | -2        |
| Under Extreme Stress                 | -2        |
| Exhausted                            | -4        |
| Extremely Drunk or Sedated           | -4        |
| Trying to Perform Task Secretly      | -4        |
| Task Obscured by Smoke, Darkness     | -4        |
>[!info]- Positive Modifiers generally come from gear, cyberware, Role Abilities, or drugs.
### Trying Again
If you fail a Skill Check, you can't try again unless your chances of success have improved for some reason— you took longer, used a better tool, or you (or one of your friends) made a Complementary Skill Check.

### Complementary Skills
Complementary Skill Checks are where the use of one Skill directly affects the use of a subsequent Skill. At the GM's discretion, a good roll in one Skill (which can even be rolled by another Character) may confer a +1 bonus to the subsequent use of a related Skill, so long as the complementary nature of the two Skills makes sense. This +1 bonus only affects a subsequent attempt once, and Complementary Skill bonuses do not stack.
### Taking Extra Time
Taking Extra Time can also give you a bonus to your Skill Check. When the GM tells you how long a task will take to complete, you can get a single +1 bonus to your Skill Check for taking four times longer.
### When You Don't Have a Skill
When you just don't have a Skill to use, but you want to try anyway, you have one option: Simply use the STAT that the Skill you don't have is linked to and add it to 1d10. That's all you get. You are relying purely on your STAT.
### Using Your LUCK
Before you roll, you can dedicate a portion of your remaining LUCK Pool (which holds LUCK Points equal to your LUCK Statistic, and which refills at the beginning of each game session) to a Check, which increases the roll by +1 for each point in your LUCK Pool that you expended. LUCK is a powerful force that can allow the otherwise impossible to become attainable
