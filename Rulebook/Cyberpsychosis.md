**Humanity Loss** is defined (for this purpose) as a loss of empathy for others and a corresponding loss of self-regard or sense of self preservation. Subjects with low Humanity have trouble emphasizing with themselves or others as "real." Instead, they start to see themselves or others as collections of parts instead of living, breathing organisms. This is basically a form of **dissociative disorder**.

**According to the Mayo Clinic**: *Dissociation is a mental process of disconnecting from one's thoughts,*
*feelings, memories, or sense of identity. The dissociation disorders that need professional treatment include*
*dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Traumatic*
*events that occur during adulthood may also cause dissociative disorders. Such events may include war, torture,*
*or living through a natural disaster.*
#### Depersonalization Disorder
*Depersonalization disorder is characterized by feeling detached from one's life, thoughts, and feelings. People*
*with this type of disorder say they feel distant and emotionally unconnected to themselves, as if they are watching*
*a character in a boring movie. Other typical symptoms include problems with concentration and memory. The*
*person may report feeling ‘spacey' or out of control. Time may slow down. They may perceive their body to be*
*a different shape or size than usual; in severe cases, they cannot recognize themselves in a mirror.*
## Cyberware
Developing cyberpsychosis is not triggered merely by putting in cyberware. It is in the
voluntary removal of a functioning body part to replace it with a machine. It is generally
not normal to voluntarily cut off a limb or remove a functioning body part. Putting in an
earring involves some self-harm, but on a level that is barely discernible to the person
doing it. It also does not require the removal of a body part. However, voluntarily choos-
ing to replace a working part for no other reason than aesthetic or functional advantage
requires that the user already be able to get past the qualms of cutting up one's body
voluntarily.
Cyberpsychosis comes about when the subject begins to compulsively alter the
body beyond the human baseline. Seeing the body as a thing—a form of Dissociative
Personality Disorder—they change it without thought.
### Why This Doesn't Count for People Who Have Non-voluntarily Needed Cyberware:
Replacing a lost or damaged body part with a new cloned part or **Medical-Grade Cyberware** (only 50eb to purchase separately, cost is included in the cost of a hospital visit in the rare circumstance when a cloned limb isn't available) will not increase dissociation. This is because the replacement of the body part makes the person feel "whole" again, increasing their level of body awareness. Now, if they replaced that limb with a cyberarm with knives in the knuckles—that choice was voluntary because it was excessive augmentation, and will thus come with Humanity Loss.
## Mental Trauma
Adding cyberware is not the only thing that can cause Humanity Loss. Humanity Loss also occurs when the subject experiences strong and traumatic events, such as torture or living through a natural disaster. And unfortunately, Edgerunners deal with these sorts of situations on a regular basis. This is something your GM controls; they often times may attach Humanity Loss on an event or situation.

| Type of Trauma                 | Example of Trauma                                                                                                                      | Humanity Loss |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Traumatic Physical Incident    | Torture                                                                                                                                | 1d6           |
| Traumatic Mental Incident      | Witnessing a particularly horrific death, mutilation, etc.                                                                             | 1d6           |
| Long-Term Mental Stress        | Kidnapping, imprisonment, Long term abuse, etc.                                                                                        | 2d6           |
| Long-Term Environmental Stress | Starvation or being trapped in a war zone, experiencing devastation from a lon-term disaster, or living in constant danger for a month | 2d6           |
## Effects of Cyberpsychosis
Cyberpsychosis is not necessarily always violent. Not all "cyberpsychos" are violent. However, a number of cases, particularly those who have already manifested psycho-pathological or sociopathic tendencies, will find those tendencies magnified to a dangerous extent. Specifically, their view of others as things to be used or harmed without thought or empathy increases dramatically.

**From the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, elements of psychopathy include:**
- Grandiose sense of self
- Need for stimulation
- Cunning and manipulative
- Lack of remorse or guilt
- Callousness and lack of empathy
- Poor behavioral controls
- Impulsivity
- Failure to accept responsibility
- Criminal Versatility

This game assumes that if you already have a low EMP, you will be more prone to these symptoms and that the act of cramming unneeded cyberware into your body may trigger this reaction.

>##### Dissociation + Psychopathic Tendencies = Cyberpsychosis | "I'm a thing" + "Everyone else is a thing" = "Why not just kill anything that gets in my way?"

So outside of a game mechanic, this works out to be:
- You already have low Empathy. Which means you are already prone to dissociative mental problems
- You also have an underlying issue with psycho-pathological/schizophrenic illnesses (low EMP to begin with)
- Easily replacing body parts for no therapeutic reason enhances dissociation. So does external and psychological trauma
- The greater the dissociation, the more likely psycho-pathological symptoms will emerge on top of the disassociation
- When angered, irritated, or just looking for stimulation, you lash out in rage, or just "for fun"
## The Rules of Cyberpsychosis
**If your Empathy (EMP) is. . .**
### 3 or Greater
No Cyberpsychosis or dissociative disorder
### Equal to 2
Borderline dissociative disorder. Do your best to role play accordingly
### Equal to 1
Dissociative disorder, borderline cyberpsychosis, Character exhibits strongly at least 3 traits from the Hare Psychopathy checklist. Do your best to role play accordingly
### Equal to 0
Cyberpsychosis. Character exhibits strongly at least 5 traits from the Hare Psychopathy checklist. Do your best to roleplay accordingly. 
### Equal to 0 and You Have Negative Humanity
Extreme cyberpsychosis. Character is handed to the GM, who plays them according to their worst tendencies. Character is handed back to the Player if their Humanity becomes a positive number again.

**Violent cyberpsychos that become a danger to public safety are hunted down by a branch of Law Enforcement known as the Psycho Squad or C-Swat. Death is a typical outcome. Capture and rehabilitation are rare.**
