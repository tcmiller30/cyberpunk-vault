## Netrunning Requirements
### Cyberware
All netrunners have at least a little cyberware. To even use a Cyberdeck, you need to plug **Interface Plugs** into it, which also requires you to have a **Neural Link**.
### Cyberdeck
Cyberdecks are the modular platforms that Programs and Hardware are installed on for the purpose of Netrunning. Both Programs and Hardware take up the same limited slots in your Cyberdeck.**What distinguishes a powerful Cyberdeck from a cheaper one is the number of slots it has for Programs and Hardware.**

| Type                        | Cost                   | Slots |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Poor Quality Cyberdeck      | 100eb (premium)        | 5     |
| Standard Quality Cyberdeck  | 500eb (Expensive)      | 7     |
| Excellent Quality Cyberdeck | 1,000eb (V. Expensive) | 9     |

### Virtuality Goggles
Since you are actually moving in the real world (aka "Meatspace") you no longer jack your optic nerves into the NET like they did before the Time of the Red. If you did it the old school way, you would be stumbling around as all your senses would be fully in Cyberspace. Instead, modern Netrunners use Virtuality Goggles, headsets that project Cyberspace imagery over their view of the world that is actually around them. This means that you will be seeing and hearing things like Black ICE while your Meatspace team buddies will see nothing. But it also means you won't trip over the door sill when you sneak into the secret biolab.
>**If you forget your Virtuality Goggles, you'll have to do it the old school**
**way, which renders you effectively Unconscious until you Jack Out, as**
**far as the meat world is concerned.**
## Doing Things in the NET
### Meat Actions vs. NET Actions
Netrunners have access to two kinds of Actions: **Meat Actions** (Non-Move Actions which take place in reality, or Meatspace) and **Net Actions** (which take place purely in the NET Architecture)
>##### On your Turn, you can take either a Meat Action or take as many NET Actions as your Interface (Net Runner Ability) allows.
>**No matter which you choose, you still get to take your Move Action.**
### NET Actions
The higher a Netrunner's Interface Rank, the more NET Actions they can take on their Turn. Interface is the Netrunner Role Ability. Without it, you cannot Netrun.
#### NET Actions per Turn

| Interface Rank  | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-9 | 10  |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Net Actions** | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
#### Jack In/Out
Enter or safely leave a NET Architecture when within 6 m/yds of an access point. Typically, a wall between you and the access point will block this Action. If you leave a NET Architecture without jacking out first, you will be in a **world of pain**.
#### Use Interface Ability
All but one [[Rulebook/Roles/Netrunner#Role Ability Interface|Interface]] Ability requires the use of at least one NET Action.
#### Activate/Deactivate Program
Activate or Deactivate one of your Programs
#### Miscellaneous
Very rarely, something you want to do in the NET won't fall into these categories. This  is rare because the **Virus Interface Ability** lets you do almost anything you can dream to a NET Architecture provided you are at the Architecture's lowst floor. If your GM allows you to do it, it will probably take a NET Action.
### What Isn't a NET Action?
Doing anything in a NET Architecture requires the use of a NET Action, except for moving and saving copies of Files.
#### Moving in a NET Architecture
You can move as much as you want in a NET Architecture on your Turn. You can't move past a NET obstruction blocking you, like a Password. Pushing your luck will get you killed if you aren't careful.
#### Saving a Copy of a File
When you find a File in an Architecture, saving a copy into your Cyberdeck isn't a NET Action.
### Jacking In or Out
Using a NET Action, you can Jack In to a NET Architecture while within range (within 6 m/yds, blocked by walls) of one of its access points. Being jacked in is a prerequisite for doing anything in an Architecture. Moving out of the access point's range while jacked in to the Architecture jacks you out of the NET Architecture automatically, but leaves you vulnerable: **You suffer the effect of all remaining enemy Black ICE you've encountered, but not Derezzed, in the NET Architecture before you get "out."** Black ICE will be explained later (on pg. 204), but you don't want this to happen to you.

It is much safer to use a NET Action to Jack Out from within the access point's range. **Jacking Out "resets" the defenses of a NET Architecture, meaning you'll have to start your run over from the very beginning, which can only be done by jacking back in to the same location you originally entered and giving it another shot**. All your Programs leave the Architecture with you when you Jack Out. If you want to have a permanent effect on the Architecture, you'll have to reach the bottom to leave a Virus.
## Interface Abilities
Netrunners can use these **Interface Abilities** with their **NET Actions** (save for Scanner). Resolution for using these abilities is as follows:
>##### Interface + 1d10 vs. DV

### Scanner
Use a **Meat Action** to find out the Meatspace loca- tion of access points to any NET Architectures in an area. The higher the Check, the more you spot from further away. It is up to the GM's discretion to deter- mine how much you find.

**Example**: *The Netrunner uses their Scanner Ability to search the building for NET Architectures and their access points to hack using a Meat Action. Rolling a 1d10 and adding their Interface (7), they get a 14. With this roll, the GM determines that the Netrunner learns the Meatspace location of two of the nearby access points for the building's NET Architecture.*
### Backdoor
Allows a Netrunner to attempt to break through Passwords in a NET Architecture using a NET Action. Of course, if you knew the password already, you automatically pass through the obstruction.

**Example**: *The Netrunner encounters a particularly difficult Password of DV10 blocking their progress while in an Architecture. Using a NET Action, they attempt to Backdoor it. They roll a d10 and add their Interface (7), getting a 16. The Password blocks the Netrunner no more.*
### Cloak
Allows you to hide traces of your presence and any Virus you left in the Architecture using a NET Action. The Pathfinder DV for another Netrunner to overcome your Cloak and discover your Actions is equal to the Cloak Check you made to create the Cloak. If you do not use the Cloak Ability before Jacking Out, another Netrunner can automatically discover what actions you took in the Architecture upon using the Pathfinder Ability.

**Example**: *After leaving their Virus on the Corporation's network, the Netrunner wants to hide any traces of their presence on the Architecture along with their Virus, so they use a NET Action to use their Cloak Ability. They roll Interface (7) + 1d10, getting a 16! An enemy Netrunner will have to beat this number with Interface + 1d10 before they can discover any traces of the Netrunner or be able to roll against any Virus that they left. If the Netrunner didn't leave such a flashy Virus, maybe the Corp wouldn't have even known that their NET Architecture was compromised!*
### Control
Allows you to control things attached to the NET Architectures like cameras, drones, turrets, laser grids, elevators, sprinklers, etc., using a Control Node. Each Node has a DV required to take control of it as a NET Action. Operating each individual thing attached to the node requires a separate NET Action once you have taken hold of the Control Node, and can be done from anywhere in the Architecture as long as you are still in control of the Control Node. **Each Control Node can only be activated once per Turn**. The DV to wrest a Control Node currently held by another Netrunner or a Demon is equal to the Control Check they made to take control of it. You lose control of any Control Nodes you hold in an Architecture when you Jack Out.

**Example**: *In an Architecture, a Netrunner encounters a DV10 Control Node that manages the cameras on this floor. By using a NET Action to use their Control Ability they roll Interface (7) + 1d10 and beat the Control Node's DV by 2. Now that they've taken control of the Control Node, they use an additional NET Action to reposition the cameras so that they will not capture the Netrunner's friends while they sneak out of the fire escape.*
### Eye-Dee
Allows you to know what a found piece of data (like a File) is and its value using a NET Action. Some Files have a DV that must be beaten to learn anything from them. 

**Example**: *After discovering an interestingly titled File, the Netrunner uses their Eye-Dee Ability with a NET Action. It's a DV9 File, so the Netrunner rolls Interface (7) + 1d10 and easily rolls higher than 9. Unfortunately, the File was a dummy left in the Architecture just to waste a Netrunner's time!*
### Pathfinder
Uses a NET Action to partially reveal the "map" of the NET Architecture. The higher your roll, the more you learn. This tells you generally what is in the NET Architecture you have just broken into, but not the DV of anything. You can see into the Architecture a number of floors equal to your Check or up to the first obstruction (usually a Password) with a DV higher than your Pathfinder Check, whichever happens first.

**Example**: *After jacking into a new NET Architecture, the Netrunner has no idea what they might be up against, so they use their Pathfinder Ability with a NET Action to find out. Rolling their Interface + 1d10, they only get a 10. The GM determines they learn only the first 3 floors of the elevator, because the third has a DV11 Password on it that blocks their view.*
### Slide
Attempt to flee combat with a single Non-Demon Black ICE Program as a NET Action. If you are able to roll a successful Slide Check against the Program's Perception + 1d10 you can escape the Black ICE to an adjacent floor of the elevator, but not past a Password or other NET obstruction. A Black ICE Program that has been successfully slid away from stops following the Netrunner and becomes a Black ICE laying in wait right where it was slid away from. **You can only attempt to Slide once per Turn**. You can't Slide preemptively.

**Example**: *In the middle of a painful conflict with a Hellhound Black ICE a Netrunner decides that they really don't have the time to get killed right now. Using a NET Action they attempt to Slide away from the Black ICE, rolling Interface (7) + 1d10 vs. the Hellhound's Perception (6) + 1d10. The Netrunner gets 14 to the Hellhound's 13. Success! The Netrunner escapes to the next floor of the elevator... Unfortunately, there is another Hellhound waiting there. This Netrunner really should have used Pathfinder! They can't Slide again until their next Turn!*
### Virus
Once you have reached the lowest level of the NET Architecture you can leave your own Virus in the Architecture to perform up to 2 actions or changes, within reason. **Using this ability is the only way a Netrunner can make a change to a NET Architecture that persists after they Jack Out**. Describe to the GM what you want the virus to do, and they will assign a DV. **A more powerful Virus will require a higher DV to leave in the Architecture, as determined by the GM. Depending what you want to do, this can require as many NET Actions as the GM determines**. Roll a Virus Check. The DV to destroy a Virus is equal to the Virus Check made to create it. 

**Example**: *After reaching the lowest level of an Architecture, the Netrunner wants to leave it worse than they found it. They explain to the GM that they want to leave a Virus in the Architecture that changes all the passwords in the Architecture every 5 minutes. The GM determines that placing such a Virus would take 9 NET Actions to leave in the Architecture and assigns a DV12. Over their next 3 Turns, the Netrunner spends all 3 of their NET Actions to complete the Virus, then rolls Interface (7) + 1d10... rolling only a 12. Their code just doesn't work so they decide to try again, spending another 9 NET Actions over another 3 Turns to try again, succeeding this time with a 15. When the Corporation later discovers the Netrunner's Virus, their Netrunner gets a headache while trying to clean up the DV15 Virus.*
#### Virus Examples
Here's some inspiration for Viruses and the time and DVs they might require to achieve. 
- Virus which forcibly alters the icon of all Asp Black ICE installed into the Architecture from fierce serpents into cute little sneks wearing tiny party hats. DV6; 1 NET Action.
- Virus which completely deactivates a particular Black ICE installed in the Architecture until the Virus is destroyed. DV10; 2 NET Actions. 
- Virus which causes a Control Node to malfunction until the Virus is destroyed. DV10; 2 NET Actions. Virus which deletes all Black ICE installed in the Architecture permanently. DV 12; 10 NET Actions. 
- Virus that causes catastrophic and lasting damage to the Net Architecture itself, halving the number of available floors permanently. DV 12; 10 NET Actions.
### Zap
Allows you to make an attack as a NET Action against a Program or enemy Netrunner. If you are able to roll a successful Zap Check against the Program's Defense Value + 1d10 or the Netrunner's Interface + 1d10, you deal 1d6 damage to the Program's REZ or directly to the Netrunner's brain.

**Example**: *A Netrunner, who already used all their Attacker Programs this Turn, still hasn't managed to finish off a Hellhound. Luckily, they have one NET Action left, so they Zap it. Rolling Interface (7) + 1d10 vs. the Hellhound's Defense (2) + 1d10 they beat the Hellhound, and deal 1d6 damage to the Hellhound's REZ, finishing it off.*
## NET Combat
When it comes to violence on the NET, here's how it goes down:
>##### Your Interface + Program ATK + 1d10 or Black ICE ATK + 1d10 vs. Target's Interface + 1d10 or Program DEF/Black ICE DEF + 1d10
>###### On a Hit, the Target suffers the Effect of the Program

A Program whose Class specifies a type of target (like Anti-Personnel or Anti-Program) is only effective when used against its intended target.

### Defeating a Program
A Program is Derezzed when it is lowered to 0 REZ (Hit Points), but this doesn't remove it from your deck or the NET Architecture. The Program is still considered to be "running," it has just been hobbled to the point of uselessness. In order to get it back to full REZ and operating condition, you'll have to spend 2 NET Actions: one to deactivate it, and one to activate it again. **Unless the Program was Destroyed, in which case it is 100% erased (and is no longer Rezzed).**
## Programs
Programs are the tools a Netrunner uses to fight, protect, and explore the electronic realm. Activating or Deactivating a Program is a NET Action. **Each Program loaded on your Cyberdeck can only be Activated once per Meatspace Round**. A Program that is currently Activated (Rezzed) cannot be Activated again until it is Deactivated.

You can run multiple copies of the same Program on your Cyberdeck if you wish to get around this limitation, and their effects will stack if they are run simultaneously, unless mentioned otherwise.

## Black ICE
Black ICE are deadly Programs that, once triggered, hunt down other Programs or Netrunners across an
Architecture. You can choose to load your deck with your own Non-Demon Black ICE, but these Programs
are much larger and will use 2 slots in your deck. Activating or Deactivating a Program is a NET Action.

>[!callout]- Installing or Unistalling a Black ICE Program takes an hour.

### Encountering Black ICE
When you encounter enemy Black ICE lying in wait in an Architecture, you roll your Interface + any SPEED bonus you have active + 1d10 vs. the Black ICE's SPEED + 1d10. If it beats your Check, you (or one of your active Programs at random in the case of Anti-Program Black ICE) suffer its effect immedi- ately. It is then placed into the Initiative Queue at the top, one number above the entity with the previously highest Initiative. On each of its Turns, it will attack the Netrunner (or one of their active Programs at random in the case of Anti-Program Black ICE) once, rolling its ATK + 1d10 vs the Netrunner's Interface + 1d10 (or Program's DEF + 1d10 if it's an Anti-Program Black ICE), doing its Effect should it succeed.

**Black ICE will chase its target through the entire Architecture until it is Derezzed or is eluded by a Netrunner who successfully used the Slide Interface Ability. Anti-Program Black ICE will continue to follow an enemy Netrunner until they are Derezzed or Slid away from even if they currently have no Programs Rezzed, as they are coded to view enemy Netrunners as a Program source. Black ICE that are eluded by a Netrunner's Slide Ability stop following their target and become a Black ICE "lying in wait" in the Architecture exactly where their pursuit ended, as described above.**

When a Netrunner Activates a Black ICE of their own using a NET Action, they can do so in one of two ways. The first is to activate their Black ICE to lie in wait at their current "floor" in the Architecture to act as described above. This can't be done in combat. The second is to activate their Black ICE during combat targeting a valid target. In this case, the Black ICE is placed into the Initiative Queue at the top, one number above the entity with the previously highest Initiative. It attacks its target once every Turn, until it is Derezzed, Destroyed, or Slid away from successfully.

To assign a new target to their Black ICE, the Netrunner needs to spend a NET Action to Deactivate it, and a NET Action to Activate it again, re-entering it into the top of the Initiative Queue and sending it at a valid target.

Your Black ICE is just as single-minded as the Black ICE you encounter. Black ICE is not a digital pet; it cannot do anything except the one thing it was coded to do.

#### Black ICE Table Key
- **Class**: The type of Program. A Program whose Class specifies a type of target (like Anti-Personnel or Anti-
Program) is only effective when used against its intended target.
- **Perception (PER)**:How hard the Black ICE is to Slide away from.
- **Speed**: How fast the Black ICE can react. A Black ICE with high SPD lying in wait is more likely to connect
with a free hit when they initially encounter a Netrunner
- **Attack (ATK)**: A number the Black ICE adds to its roll when attacking during its Turn.
- **Defense (DEF)**: A number the Black ICE adds to its roll when defending against an attack.
- **REZ**: The Program's Hit Points, or the amount of damage it can sustain while Rezzed before it is Derezzed.
- **Effect**: The Effect caused when the Black ICE hits with an attack
- **Icon**: The appearance of the Program in the NET. Many Netrunners customize the look of their Black ICE Programs.
- **Cost**: What the Program costs, including the Price Category

## Cyberdeck Hardware
Just like a Cyberdeck's Option Slots can be used to hold Programs, they can also be used to hold Hardware. How to allocate these Slots between extra copies of your favorite Programs, dangerous Black ICE, and helpful Hardware comes down to personal preference.

| <br><br><br>Backup Drive | While installed on a Cyberdeck, a Backup Drive "saves" Non-Black ICE Attacker, Defender, or Booster Programs that are destroyed by pulling them into the Backup Drive the instant before they meet their end. As a Meat Action, a Netrunner can re-install all Programs "saved" by the Backup Drive onto their deck, if they have the Slots for them. If removed from a Cyberdeck, the Backup Drive erases its contents automatically. Restored Programs with once-per-Netrun restrictions and the like are restored in the exact state they were saved in, so you can't kill your own Armor to refresh it. Yeah, that means you.

## Doing a Netrun
**It's easier to think of Netrunning like an Elevator.**

Each floor of a NET Architecture is a level where, as the "door" opens, you find something waiting for you. It could be a Program, Black ICE, another Netrunner, File, Control Node, etc.

**Every Turn, you can go down through the Architecture as many floors as you want,** assuming you aren't blocked by a Password or other NET Obstruction. **You don't get to skip any floors.** You still only have a limited number of NET Actions each Turn.

You have to open every door in order... and behind plenty of them, there's a Black ICE that will attempt to punish you immediately for opening its door unless you are fast enough, and will enter at the top of the Initiative Queue even if you were faster. **How far can you press your luck?** Do you take things slowly, defeating each Black ICE as you encounter them, or will you Slide recklessly, even into danger, riskily opening door after door, dodging the initial attacks of all Black ICE lying in wait for you, and safely Jacking Out with your final NET Action before the Black ICE you've left active in the NET Architecture even get a chance to take a Turn?
#### Example NET Architecture

| Floor | The Other Side of the "Door" | DV             |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1     | File                         | (Eye-Dee DV6)  |
| 2     | Password                     | (Backdoor DV8) |
| 3     | Control Node (Cameras)       | (Control DV10) |
| 4     | Password                     | (Backdoor DV8) |
| 5     | Asp                          | N/A            |
| 6     | Control Node (Security Door) | (Control DV10) |
| 7     | Hellhound                    | N/A            |
## Building a NET Architecture
**Step by Step Creation for GMs**
Creating a NET Architecture for your Netrunner Player is simple. You could generate one on the fly if needed, but you probably want to do this ahead of time. Once you've decided on a NET Architecture Difficulty Rating that fits what you are looking for, the rest is as simple as 1, 2, 3.
### Step 0: The Difficulty Rating
Depending on how hardcore the NET Architecture you are creating is, its defenses will be accordingly tough.
Controlling the Difficulty Rating is a good way to make sure your NET Architecture will challenge your Netrunner
(giving them a fighting chance) without outright killing them. A Standard Difficulty Rating is a good place to start.

|                                                                   | Basic Difficulty | Standard Difficulty | Uncommon Difficulty | Advanced Difficulty |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Password/File/Control Node DV                                     | DV6              | DV8                 | DV10                | DV12                |
| Interface of a Netrunner with a Fighting Chance                   | 2                | 4                   | 6                   | 8                   |
| Interface of a Netrunner who Might Die Before Reaching the Bottom | N/A              | 2 or less           | 4 or less           | 6 or less           |

### Step 1: Shape the Architecture
Roll 3d6. This is the total number of floors the Architecture will have. Roll a d10; If you got 7 or higher, the
Architecture has a branch in it. Roll that d10 again to see if you get another branch. When you don't, stop. Split
up the total number of floors between the main branch and any branches you've rolled, according to your taste.
**A NET Architecture cannot branch until after the second floor in the main branch**. Make sure
that there is also a longest branch in the Architecture, so that there is a defined "bottom" to the NET Architecture,
where a Netrunner can leave a Virus.
### Step 2: Fill in the Architecture
See the NET Architecture Difficulty Value table, just above, and decide on the NET Architecture Difficulty Rating you want. **Keep in mind the Interface Rank of your Netrunner Player Character**. Start at the highest floor of the Architecture and work your way down. For the first two floors in the NET Architecture, roll on the Lobby table below to determine what can be found on each floor, **re-rolling any Program or Password entries already rolled**. Continue working your way down. For the remaining floors of the NET Architecture, roll on the NET Architecture Body table that corresponds to the Difficulty Rating you assigned to the Architecture to determine what can be found on each floor, **re-rolling any Program or Password entries already rolled**.

Using this method, the deeper a Netrunner ventures into a NET Architecture, the more likely they are to find valuable Files or useful Control Nodes.
### Step 3: Fit the Architecture to the World Around It
For every File or Control Node in the Architecture you've generated, make sure it has a reason to exist in the Meatspace that the Architecture is installed in. Files and Control Nodes are the "treasure" of Netrunning, so it's important to make their impact on gameplay and the world a real one that makes sense given the location they are found in. Somebody important in the building will probably know the Passwords for the Architecture. Of course, they won't share such information openly. A Control Node doesn't have to be entirely combat-oriented either. **Cameras, sprinklers, sirens, assembly line conveyor belts, video display feeds, chlorination control valves, electronically engaged door locks, massage chairs, soda machines, air conditioning, and pitching machines all make great Control Nodes too**.

If there are Control Nodes in the Architecture, decide what they are and if a Demon is present to operate them. Any Active Defenses will need a Demon present to run them. Try to fit the Demon to its location. When in doubt, Imps are commonplace. The local movie theater's NET Architecture probably isn't running a Balron unless it's hiding something.

In the spirit of fitting the Architecture to its Meatspace location, feel free to replace any Program you've gener- ated with another Program of the same Cost and swap around any floors you've generated in the Architecture. Or, instead of rolling, pick whichever floors you want in step two for a more custom approach that also maintains game balance. Sparingly, you can even pick a floor from a NET Architecture from one Difficulty Rating higher than the one you are currently generating to make a "Boss Floor" of sorts.
