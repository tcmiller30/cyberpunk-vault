## Netrunning Requirements
### Cyberware
All netrunners have at least a little cyberware. To even use a Cyberdeck, you need to plug **Interface Plugs** into it, which also requires you to have a **Neural Link**.
### Cyberdeck
Cyberdecks are the modular platforms that Programs and Hardware are installed on for the purpose of Netrunning. Both Programs and Hardware take up the same limited slots in your Cyberdeck.**What distinguishes a powerful Cyberdeck from a cheaper one is the number of slots it has for Programs and Hardware.**

| Type                        | Cost                   | Slots |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Poor Quality Cyberdeck      | 100eb (premium)        | 5     |
| Standard Quality Cyberdeck  | 500eb (Expensive)      | 7     |
| Excellent Quality Cyberdeck | 1,000eb (V. Expensive) | 9     |

### Virtuality Goggles
Since you are actually moving in the real world (aka "Meatspace") you no longer jack your optic nerves into the NET like they did before the Time of the Red. If you did it the old school way, you would be stumbling around as all your senses would be fully in Cyberspace. Instead, modern Netrunners use Virtuality Goggles, headsets that project Cyberspace imagery over their view of the world that is actually around them. This means that you will be seeing and hearing things like Black ICE while your Meatspace team buddies will see nothing. But it also means you won't trip over the door sill when you sneak into the secret biolab.

**way, which renders you effectively Unconscious until you Jack Out, as**
**far as the meat world is concerned.**
## Doing Things in the NET
### Meat Actions vs. NET Actions
Netrunners have access to two kinds of Actions: **Meat Actions** (Non-Move Actions which take place in reality, or Meatspace) and **Net Actions** (which take place purely in the NET Architecture)
>##### On your Turn, you can take either a Meat Action or take as many NET Actions as your Interface (Net Runner Ability) allows.
>**No matter which you choose, you still get to take your Move Action.**
### NET Actions
The higher a Netrunner's Interface Rank, the more NET Actions they can take on their Turn. Interface is the Netrunner Role Ability. Without it, you cannot Netrun.
#### NET Actions per Turn

| Interface Rank  | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-9 | 10  |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Net Actions** | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
#### Jack In/Out
Enter or safely leave a NET Architecture when within 6 m/yds of an access point. Typically, a wall between you and the access point will block this Action. If you leave a NET Architecture without jacking out first, you will be in a **world of pain**.
#### Use Interface Ability
All but one Interface Ability requires the use of at least one NET Action.()
