Empathy is a STAT, and for each point of EMP you have, you have 10 points of Humanity. A Character that starts with 5 EMP has 50 Humanity, for example. As you undergo Humanity Loss (mainly through install- ing cybernetics), you'll lose points of Humanity. Every time you lose enough Humanity that the ten's place on your Humanity changes, like going from 50 Humanity to 46 Humanity, your EMP is effectively lowered to the ten's place of your Humanity, in this case, EMP 5 to EMP 4.

**That's where Therapy comes in. When you want to keep all your Cybernetics without feeling less empathetic, or when you want to kick an addiction**. It's certainly not cheap, or easy, but it is quite fast when compared to similar treatments from yesteryear. Most of the improvements in the effi- ciency of these therapies are due to pharmaceuticals pioneered by Biotechnica during the 4th Corporate War.

A skilled Medtech can perform therapies on their own, using the Medical Tech Skill granted to them through their Role Ability, Medicine. Each of these therapies takes 1 entire week, during which the doctor and their patient can do nothing else. At the end of the week, the doctor rolls against the DV of the Therapy. On a success, the patient gains the Effect of the Therapy. **On a failed Check, the entire week was for nothing, and any materi- als used were lost. The materials used for these Therapies are controlled entirely by Biotechnica, and they must be purchased directly from the company.** The price listed for Therapy assumes the patient is not sleeping in the hospital overnight during the Therapy process. If they are, they must pay 100eb per night, as standard.

**Medtechs can't do Therapy on themselves.**

## Addiction Therapy
One week of intensive psychotherapy combined with a flight of anti-addiction drugs in a safe environment.

**Effect**: Patient is freed of one of their addictions. However, whenever they roll against the Secondary Effect of the source of their addiction for 1 year after getting clean, they automatically fail the roll.
