Years ago, the Corps drove your family off the farm. They rolled in, took over the land, and put rent-a-cops all over the place. But that was before the War. You were loners, homeless, until you created a Nomad Pack of nearly two-hundred members. Back then, your Pack was crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, buses, and RVs roaming the freeways looking for supplies, odd jobs, and spare parts in a fragmented world. The Pack was your home—it had teachers, Medtechs, leaders, and mechanics—a virtual town on wheels in which everyone was related by marriage or kinship. But in the Time of the Red, your Nomad Pack has evolved. Your knowledge of roadcraft—of how to get between the safezones over the savage highways has allowed you to become the masters of getting people, supplies, and materials to a world that desperately needs them. Your cousins on the open seas have taken over the huge container ships and turned them into the Nomad convoys keeping civilization running. Your Deltajock fam- boys keep the supply lines to the Orbital Highriders open. If it has to get somewhere and get there safely, Nomads get the job done. Your vehicles are well-armored and bristling with stolen weapons: miniguns, rocket launchers, and the like. Every kid knows how to use a rifle, and everyone packs a knife. Like modern-day cowboys, you ride the hard trail. You've got a gun, a bike, and your Family, and that's all you need. You're a Nomad.
## Role Ability: Moto
The difference between most people and Nomads is that Nomads have better cars.
### Nomad Vehicle Familiarity
Being part of a Nomad Family means spending your life in the driver's seat and under the hood, improving your driving abilities and vehicle knowledge enough to get by on familiarity alone or with training to pull off impressive feats with ease. **A Nomad adds their Moto Rank to any Drive Land Vehicle, Pilot Air Vehicle, Pilot** **Sea Vehicle, Air Vehicle Tech, Land Vehicle Tech, or Sea Vehicle Tech Skill Check they make.**
### Family Motorpool
Whenever a Nomad increases their Role Ability Rank, they have the option of:
- **Either** adding a stock vehicle (with minimum specs) of their Moto Rank or lower to the pool of vehicles they have permission to use from the Family Motorpool.
- **Or** upgrading one of the Nomad's already permitted Family Vehicles with a single upgrade of their Moto Rank or lower.

A Nomad can only have one of their Family Vehicles out at a time. A Nomad can call one of their Family to get their current Family Vehicle swapped out with another of their loaned Family Vehicles, and, assuming their Family is close by, the vehicle can be swapped out the following morning.

If destroyed, the Family will fully repair any Family Vehicle for the Nomad, but it will take a week's time. The Nomad will also be expected to pay 500eb for the service. Even Family Heads pay this because it's a way of saving face for damaging Family property. It might be waived if you are broke, but your reputation would suffer. Daily repairs like bullet removal are the Nomad's responsibility.

Upon attaining the 10th Rank in their Role Ability, a Nomad is promoted to a leadership position in their Family, with all the responsibility that entails. While leading by example, such a Nomad can have all their Family Vehicles out at a time. Any future Family Vehicles they wish to purchase are bought at market price, and any future upgrades they desire can be bought at 1,000eb a piece.

### Nomad Vehicle Upgrades
Unless stated otherwise, an option can only be taken once per vehicle. These upgrades are also rarely sold on
the open market, at Very Expensive for those attainable at Moto Rank 1, and at Luxury for those not attainable
at Rank 1.

| <br>1                 | **NOS**: A burst of power when you need it. Allows you to use your Action to use an additional Move Action when driving a vehicle. Each tank of NOS can be used once per day. Each additional upgrade adds an additional tank. The tanks capture nitrogen and oxygen from the air and synthesize nitrous oxide on their own, never needing refilling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Cannot be reloaded while driving.<br>Weapon cannot be removed and cannot accept weapon attachments.<br>Multiple upgrades can be installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <br><br><br>1         | **Onboard Machine gun**: An **Assault Rifle with 30 rounds only capable of using Autofire** that you can mount front facing on the exterior of a vehicle. The driver can fire it using their Action. Cannot be reloaded while driving.<br><br>Weapon cannot be removed and cannot accept weapon attachments.<br><br>Multiple upgrades can be installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <br><br><br><br>1     | **Seating Upgrade**: Adds two seats to the vehicle. If desired, these extra seats can come in a sidecar, which can be fully enclosed with the same glass as the rest of the vehicle, with side windows optional. Additionally, any seats in a vehicle with this upgrade can be rigged as ejector seats, firing the contents of the seat 10 m/yds into the air above the vehicle, through a trapdoor mechanism in the ceiling of the vehicle, if needed. An ejected passenger struck by a helicopter blade during such an ejection takes damage as if they had been struck by a **Very Heavy Melee Weapon**. Typically, these ejection seats are rigged with parachutes, but these could always be removed.<br><br>This upgrade can be taken multiple times for all vehicles except Bikes, Jetskis, and Gyrocopters.                                                                                                                                     |
| <br><br><br><br><br>5 | **Security Upgrade**: Replaces all the locks on the vehicle with DNA locks, which can be set up to accept a thumbprint, iris scan, blood sample, or any other desired biometric method. Such a lock cannot be unlocked without either its biometric key or a DV 17 Electronics/Security Tech Check. A person who presents an inaccurate biometric key, or fails a Check to open one of the locks without the correct biometric key is struck as if they had been hit in the body by a Stun Baton if they are within two m/yds of the vehicle.<br><br>Additionally, the Security Upgrade adds a cloaking feature to the vehicle, allowing it to hide itself from all but a DV17 Perception Check, assuming it remains still. System takes a minute to engage, and operates by taking a video of the vehicle's surroundings and projecting it on the surface of the vehicle in real time, aided in part by nano-machines which cover hard-to-reach areas. |
| <br><br>1             | Smuggling Upgrade: Upgrades the vehicle with two onboard Hidden Holsters (exactly the same rules-wise as the Cyberware of the same name) which provide the driver and one passenger with an easily accessible concealed weapon, and one large space hidden somewhere within the vehicle for smuggling purposes. These spaces can only be discovered with a DV17 Conceal/Reveal Object Check.

The passenger also can reload this mounted weapon while the vehicle is in motion. This weapon can be removed or reinstalled using an Action. The first time a Nomad upgrades one of their vehicles with one of these, their Family will include with it a **Tsunami Arms Helix, Rhinemetall EMG-86 Railgun**, or **Militech "Cowboy" U-56 Grenade Launcher** as a gift, but all others are up to the Nomad to source. If the vehicle has Bulletproof Glass, a bubble of the same glass protects the gunner.<br><br>Multiple upgrades can only be installed on Cabin Cruisers, Yachts, Aerozeps, and Groundcars that already have the Housing Capacity Upgrade installed. <br><br>**Requires Heavy Chassis.** |

| <br><br><br>5 | **Enhanced Interface Plug Integration**: When you use your Interface Plugs to drive your bike with this upgrade, if you can dodge bullets (REF 8 or higher), and you, a passenger on your bike, or your bike are targeted by an attack that you could dodge or otherwise avoid on foot,<br>you can attempt to dodge or avoid that attack with your Evasion Skill, just like you would if you were on foot. Your choice to dodge "becomes" the chosen defense of your passenger automatically. In the case of an explosive or other area attack, your bike swerves out of its range if you successfully dodge, just as such an effect would cause you to do if you were on foot. |

| <br><br>1     | **Deployable Spike Strip**: Can be deployed by the driver as an Action. When deployed, any closely trailing vehicles with tires must make a DV17 Drive Land Vehicle Check. Should they fail the Check, their vehicle takes 4d6 damage to its weak point (damage that gets through any vehicle's SP is multiplied by 2). Replacement spike strips are 10eb (Cheap). Multiple upgrades increase the amount of spike strips that can be deployed before the mechanism needs to be reloaded, which can't happen while the vehicle is moving. |
