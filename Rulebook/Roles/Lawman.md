In the old days before the War, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make a Minami-10 look like a kid's toy. But even so, you're out there doing what you can to Protect—and Serve. 

There used to be a big City Force, but most of the Old Guard in NCPD have been thrown out on their own to keep what peace they can. The ones who remain still take the Badge seriously; they work to keep people safe and make some kind of stand against chaos. Even if you'd rather just walk a beat, if you're a professional Lawman of any stripe, you're stuck carrying at least four high-caliber weapons, most of them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar ® vest that'll stop 850ft/lbs. per square inch—and often you're still outgunned and outflanked. Half the gangs were cybered up to begin with: super speed, super reflexes, could see in the dark, carried weapons in their arms...and that was before the War and the Fall of the Towers pumped a metric ton of milspec cybertech into the Night Markets. The other half of the guys on The Street are free- lance Corporate mercs who used to have jobs during the War; hired to enforce Corp armies disbanded by the New United States' goon squads. Now they're the goon squads and you're trying to keep them under control too. Used to be the Corporate Cops had heavy weapons, full combat armor, Trauma Team backup, AV-4 assault vehicles, and gyrocopters with miniguns. But the nice, clean sectors full of new office buildings and fancy restaurants—where no jacked-up psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing spree with an FN-RAL37—are mostly gone. Now you've got mostly burned-out buildings and abandoned cars, where every night is a new firefight and another great opportunity for a messy death. Or you might draw a Psycho Squad berth and get the job of hunting down heavily armed and armored cyborgs who've flipped out. A cyberpsycho can walk through machine gun fire and not even feel it, so a lot of the Psycho Squad become a bit crazy themselves; they load up with boosted reflexes, get some monstrously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs solo. But you're not that crazy. Yet.
## Role Ability: Backup
The Lawman's Role Ability is Backup. Lawmen can call upon the help of a group of fellow law enforcers, based on the Lawman's Backup Rank and the conditions under which the call is made. The Backup will be armed and armored based on the table below, and will be played by the GM.

As a Lawman increases in Rank, they are likely to be promoted within their current law enforcement organization or to be recruited by law enforcement agencies that they can currently call Backup from.

**When in danger,** you can call on Backup from a group of your Backup Rank or lower. As an Action, you attempt to roll equal or lower than your Backup Rank on a d10 to get someone to respond to your call. **If you abuse this, your Boss will throw you off the force or fine you as they see fit.**

After someone responds to your call, you roll a d6 to find out in how many Rounds your backup will arrive on the scene. If you roll a 6 on this roll, instead of your typical backup, the backup that arrives will be of the next highest level of backup, unless you are Rank 10, in which case two separate backup groups will arrive. **If nobody responds to your call, you can always try your backup call again next Turn**.
### Backup Ranks
- **Combat Number**: A Skill Base used for both offense and defense. This number combines both STAT and Skill for them. You will add a d10 roll to this value whenever attacking with their carried weapons or equipment or defending. **Backup cannot dodge bullets.**
- **SP**: The stopping power of the armor on both their Body and Head location.
- **HP**: The amount of Hit Points that each member of the backup has.

Unlike all other forms of Backup, these serious hitters stick around after the conflict ends and assist in investi-
gating the scene. While they will not travel with the Crew on a day-to-day basis, after the first time they are
called the same 2 serious hitters will always respond to calls for backup connected to the initial call until the
"case" is closed, or they fall in the line of duty.

Additionally, they can use their Combat Number for these Skills: Accounting, Acting, Conceal/Reveal Object,
Criminology, Cryptography, Deduction, Education, Forgery, Interrogation, Paramedic, Perception, Personal
Grooming, Resist Torture/Drugs, Stealth, and Tracking.
