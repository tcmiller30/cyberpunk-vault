You were reborn with a gun in your hand—the flesh and blood hand—not the metallic weapons factory that covers most of your other arm. Whether as a freelance guard and killer-for-hire, or as one of the Corporate cybersoldiers who enforce business deals and the Company's "black operations," you're one of the elite fighting machines of the Time of the Red. Most Solos put in military time during the 4th Corporate War, in a Corporate army, or in one of the government's current "police actions" around the country. As the battle damage piles up, you start to rely more and more upon tech: cyberlimbs for weapons and armor, bio-program chips to increase your reflexes and awareness, combat drugs to give you that edge over your opponents. When you're the best of the best, you might even leave the ranks of Corporate samurai and go ronin—freelanc- ing your lethal talents as a killer, bodyguard, or enforcer to whoever can pay your very high fees. Sounds good? There's a price—a heavy one. You've lost so much of your original meat body that you're almost a machine. Your killing reflexes are so jacked up that you have to restrain yourself from going berserk at any moment. Years of combat drugs taken to keep the edge have given you terrifying addictions. There are few people you can trust anymore. One night you might sleep in a penthouse condo in the City, the next in a filthy alley on The Street. But that's the price of being the best. And you're willing to pay it. Because you're a Solo.
## Role Ability: Combat Awareness
When combat begins (before Initiative is rolled), anytime outside of combat, or in combat
with an Action, a Solo may divide the total number of points they have in their Combat
Awareness Role Ability among the following abilities. If a Solo chooses to not change
their point assignments, their previous ones persist. Activating some of these abilities will
cost the Solo more points than others:
### Damage Deflection
You have been trained to "roll with the punches," reducing damage done to you.
• For 2 points, decrease the first damage you take this Round by 1.
• For 4 points, decrease the first damage you take this Round by 2.
• For 6 points, decrease the first damage you take this Round by 3.
• For 8 points, decrease the first damage you take this Round by 4.
• For 10 points, decrease the first damage you take this Round by 5.
### Fumble Recovery
You have been trained to instantly recover from mishaps by taking your time with every
shot. For 4 points, you ignore critical failures (1s) you roll while attacking. These rolls are
still treated as 1, however.
### Initiative Reaction
Your reflexes are trained to respond instantly, without thinking, at the start of a firefight.
Each point adds a +1 to Initiative rolls made.
### Precision Attack
You have been trained to precisely aim attacks, giving you greater accuracy.
• For 3 points, you add a +1 to any Attacks made.
• For 6 points, you add a +2 to any Attacks made.
• For 9 points, you add a +3 to any Attacks made.
### Spot Weakness
You have been trained to look for weak spots to damage even heavily armored targets.
Each point adds a +1 to the damage (before armor) of your first successful Attack in a
Round.
### Threat Detection
You have enhanced situational awareness. Each point adds a +1 to any Perception
Checks made.
