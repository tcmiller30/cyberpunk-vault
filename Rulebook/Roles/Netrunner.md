You're a brain-burning computer hacker & master of the Post-NET cyberverse in the Time of the Red. At three, your parents bought you an old Kirama LPD-12 cyberdeck with Zetatech 526 optical goggles (you were too young for interface plugs), and your life was changed. By fifth grade, you were already using REFRAME-G1s meta-programming to crack into the school district's system and change your grades. When you were thirteen, you shifted enough funds out of unprotected Trans United Bank accounts to finance your first neural interface plugs. You couldn't wait to run high and fast with the other gods of the NETâ€”Bartmoss, Magnificent Curtis, and the rest. Then the 4th Corp War blew the Old NET apart. The R.A.B.I.D.S. made NET travel a suicide run; the Nodes were fragmented or cor- rupted. But there were still places to run. You just had to go there and jack in the hard way. You traded in sitting on the couch for a Bodyweight combat bodysuit and Virtuality 5 interface goggles to mesh NET with Meatspace. The systems you cracked were smaller, but even deadlier. Now, you're really part of a team, with Solos to cover your back, Medtechs to restart your heart if the ICE gets you, and Techs to help you hot-wire your cyber- deck for more speed and software deployment. Now, nothing can stop you. As an electronic wraith, you slip into the "hardest" mainframe systems with ease: stealing, trading, and selling their deepest secrets at will. The Black ICE may still kill you in the end, but until the ride runs out you'll be there, bare-brained and headfirst in the New NET.
## Role Ability: Interface
A Netrunner's Interface Role Ability allows them to Netrun, determines how many NET Actions they can take
on their Turn, and gives them access to a suite of Interface Abilities. **(See [[Netrunning]])**
### NET Actions per Turn

| Interface Rank  | 1 to 3 | 4 to 6 | 7 to 9 | 10  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
| **NET Actions** | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5   |
### Interface Abilities

| Ability    | Data                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backdoor   | Allows the Netrunner to break through Passwords and other obstructions in the Architecture. |
| Cloak      | Allows the Netrunner to hide their actions in the Architecture before they leave.           |
| Control    | Allows the Netrunner to control things that are attached to the Architecture.               |
| Eye-Dee    | Allows the Netrunner to know what a found piece of data is and its value.                   |
| Pathfinder | Allows the Netrunner to learn the "map" of the Architecture.                                |
| Scanner    | Allows the Netrunner to find out the locations of systems in an area.                       |
| Slide      | Allows the Netrunner to slip away from one Black ICE that is following them.                |
| Virus      | Allows the Netrunner to leave a custom virus at the very core of the Architecture.          |
| Zap        | A basic Netrunner attack that works against both Programs and other Netrunners.             |
