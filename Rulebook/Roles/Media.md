They're bending the truth out there. And you're going to stop them. Someone has to do it. The Corporations used to rule the world. They dumped toxics, destabilized economies, and com- mitted murder with equal impunity. The government back then couldn't even stop them—hell, they owned the government. But then the War came.

The War stripped away the facade and let us all know exactly what had been going on under our noses. And the people who made sure we all knew the score were the Medias. That's you. You've got a vidlink and a press pass, and you're not afraid to use them. You're a city-wide figure, seen nightly all over the Data Pool in the Time of the Red. It's not like the old days, when you had a major Mediacorp behind you; this time, you've gotta depend on your fans, your contacts, and your own reputation. But it's harder for these new Corps to make you disappear. So when you dig down for the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate lapdogs try to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can put the details of their crimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens. Three or four times, the bad guys have tried to kill you—that's why your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of the top ‘Runners in the business digging through NET Architectures to back your stories. You have to be good, or else.

Your ‘Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. You grab your gear and flag your backup. You're going to break those bastards. This time, for sure.
## Role Ability: Credibility
The Media Role Ability is Credibility. The Media not only can convince an audience of
what they publish, but also has a larger audience the more credible they are. They also
have greater levels of access to sources and information. Medias are also in the know
and pick up on rumors passively.
### Rumors
Medias are deeply plugged into information networks. Assuming you aren't entirely
off-grid, at least twice per week the GM will secretly roll Your Credibility Rank + 1d10.
If the Check beats any of the DVs on the Rumor Table's Passive column, the GM will
clue the Media in on the highest DV rumor which their Check beat. These are the same
rumors that a Media might find by hitting The Street during gameplay using their relevant
information gathering skills like Library Search, Conversation, or Interrogation.

**When a Media is actively looking for Rumors:**

| Rumor              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Passive DV | Active DV |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Vague Rumor        | The rumor is hazy. It contains the bare minimum of information required to start hunting down the supposed truth at the core of it                                                                                           | 7          | 13        |
| Typical Rumor      | The rumor is enough to know where to go next in an investigation. It contains enough information to get a passing glimpse at the supposed truth at the core of it.                                                           | <br>9      | <br>15    |
| Substantial Rumor  | As Typical Rumor, but the rumor additionally contains concrete<br>information that is beneficial to a potential investigation, like names,<br>places, and times.                                                             | <br>11     | <br>17    |
| <br>Detailed Rumor | As Substantial Rumor, but the rumor additionally contains information that, if verified, could become a piece of evidence the Media can use in a story they might publish about the supposed truth at the core of the rumor. | <br>13     | <br>21    |
>#####Rumors, by definition, are often untrue, and are never the full story. Finding that is your job. Remember, some threads are dangerous to pull.

### Publishing Stories or Scoops
>- **Access/Sources** represent those you can reasonably get in touch with/interview or otherwise gain information from
>- **Audience** is how many people your stories or exposés can reach.
>- **Believability** is how well your story or exposé goes over with your audience. The higher your Credibility, the more likely people will believe something you have written or broadcast. You roll 1d10 based on your believability when you publish a story and any time you want to find out whether an individual (or group of individuals) believe your story.**If your story contains even a single piece of verifiable evidence that is easily understood by the masses, the chance your audience will believe it is 1 higher. If it contains more than 4 distinct verifiable pieces of hard evidence, the chance your audience will believe it is 2 higher. These two bonuses stack with each other.** LUCK can never be spent on a Believability Check.
>- **Impact** is how much change any individual story or revelation you publish has on your audience. For example, a story about an unfair economic practice at the incremental level might just get a few local bosses to change their practices. But at higher levels of Credibility, your exposé may cause entire Megacorps to fall. **Once you publish a story/scoop, you cannot publish another story on the same exact topic unless you have new information to add to the conversation**
