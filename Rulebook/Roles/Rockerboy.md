If you live to rock, this is where you belong. As a Rockerboy, you're one of the street poets, the social conscience, and the rebels of the Time of the Red. With the advent of digital porta-studios and garage music mastering, every Rockerboy with a message can take it to The Street, put it in the record stores, bounce it off the comsats. Sometimes, your message isn't something the Corporations or the government wants to hear. Sometimes what you say is going to get right in the faces of the powerful people who really want to run this world. But you don't care, because as a Rockerboy, you know it's your place to challenge authority, whether in straight-out protest songs that tell it like it is, playing kick-ass rock n' roll to get the people away from the TV sets and into The Streets, firing up the crowd with speeches, or composing fiery writings that shape the minds and hearts of millions. You have a proud history as a Rockerboy. Dylan, Springsteen, U2, NWA, the Who, Jett, the Stones—the legions of hard-rock heroes who told the truth with screaming guitars or gut-honest lyrics. You have the power to get the people up; to lead, inspire, and inform. Your message can give the timid courage, the weak strength, and the blind vision. Rockerboy legends like Johnny Silverhand, Rockerboy Manson (for whom the Role is named) and Kerry Eurodyne have led armies against Corporations and governments. Rockerboys have exposed corruption and brought down dictators. It's a lot of power for someone doing gigs every night in another city. But you can handle it. After all: you came to play!
## Role Ability: Charismatic Impact
The Rockerboy's Role Ability is Charismatic Impact. With this ability, they can influence others by sheer presence of personality. They need not be a musical performer; they can influence others through poetry, art, dance, or simply their physical presence. They could be a rocker—or a cult leader. As they grow in skill, they can affect larger and larger groups and call on their fans for greater and greater requests of loyalty.

**A Rockerboy can only use their Charismatic Impact Ability on Fans.**

Assuming you aren't in combat, you can make people who aren't currently fans into fans (unless they actively dislike you) by rolling **Charismatic Impact + 1d10 vs a DV8 for a Single Person, DV10 for a Small Group of up to 6, or DV12 for a Huge Group**

**The GM determines whenever someone you meet is already a Fan.**

When a Rockerboy wants to make use of their Charismatic Impact on a fan or group of fans, the GM uses the table below to determine if the favor is something within the powers of their Charismatic Impact given their current Role Ability Rank. If it isn't, the Rockerboy automatically fails. **If it is, the group size determines the DV against which the Rockerboy must roll Charismatic Impact + 1d10**. If they succeed, the fan or group of fans puts their best effort toward the favor the Rockerboy asked for. If they fail, the Rockerboy can't ask for the same favor again from those fans for a week.
