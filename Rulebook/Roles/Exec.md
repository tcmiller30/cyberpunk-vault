In the old days before the Time of the Red, you would have been a hard- driven, fast-track MBA on their way up the Corporate ladder. Sure, it was selling your soul to the Company, but face it: the Corporations ruled the world. They controlled governments, markets, nations, armies—you name it. And you knew that whoever controlled the Corporations controlled everything else. But things changed when the largest Megacorps on the planet got into a major war that was equal to anything any real national governments could have thrown down. 

Okay, so right now your life as a junior executive is any- thing but easy. There are those underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job. Literally. There are those over you who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs. Literally. And they're not kidding about the killing—every up-and-comer in the Corporation has their own Team of Solos and Netrunners to cover important pet projects. Last week, you led a mixed team of Solos, Netrunners, and Techs on a headhunting run to "extract" a researcher from a rival company. You told yourself you joined the Corporation to make it a better place—work from the inside, you said. Or just until you could start your own Corporation that would be...a little more honest. But now you're not so sure. Your ideals are a little tarnished and things are getting pretty bleak. But you can't worry about ethics now. You've got a report due in an hour, and it looks like that guy in sales is planning to ice your database for good. 

You're gonna ice him first.
## Role Ability: Teamwork
Just like a real corporate executive, the Exec builds a team whose members help them accomplish their goals, whether legal or not, morale permitting. The Exec Role Ability is Teamwork.
### Signing Bonus
**At Teamwork Rank 1**, as a gift, the Exec is given a suit comprised of a Businesswear Jacket, Top, Bottom, and Footwear that identify them as a member of the business elite. The exec cannot resell these without raising suspicion.
### Corporate Housing
**At Teamwork Rank 2**, the Exec is given access to one of their Company's
Corporate Conapts. As long as they remain a member of that Corporation, they
can stay there without paying any Rent or any other fees. The Exec must still buy their
own Lifestyle separately every month. If the Exec leaves to join another Corporation,
they will extend to them the same offer, and even pay to move all their stuff to the
new apartment.

**At Teamwork Rank 7**, the Exec's corporate housing is improved to a Beaverville
House in the Executive Zone.

**At Teamwork Rank 10**, the Exec's corporate housing is improved dramatically to a
Beaverville McMansion in the Executive Zone or a Luxury Penthouse in the Corporate
Zone.

### Corporate Health Insurance
**At Teamwork Rank 6, the Exec is given Trauma Team Silver coverage, paid for monthly by their Corporation**. If the Exec leaves to join another Corporation, they will extend to them the same offer.

**At Teamwork Rank 8**, the Corporation upgrades their coverage to Trauma Team Executive.
### Team Members
**Starting at Rank 3**, Teamwork give the Exec a Team Member. **Ranks 5 and 9** of Teamwork give the Exec
an additional Team Member, capping out at **a maximum of 3 total Team Members at Rank 9**.

Team Members are rolled from a special chart for each of their jobs. The Exec chooses which class of Team
Members they want, but their roll on the chart determines the STATs of the Team Member HR hires for them.

While constructed like Player Characters, they vary in several distinct ways.
>- They do not improve their Skills. They determine and heal their HP like Player Characters do.
>- They are controlled by the GM, and their ability to follow an order depends on their Loyalty and ability to make a Loyalty Check.
>- **They cannot wear Armor other than Light Armorjack.** Company Policy.
#### Losing Team Members
If a Team Member is lost, HR will repossess their equipment and replace them during the next game session. This "new hire" has new STATs, but their starting Loyalty is reduced by 1 (they heard about what happened) **In addition, this will cost the Exec an additional 200eb in "hiring fees" (bribes) to HR.**
#### Loyalty
While Team Members work for the Exec, they are not mindless drones. They do the tasks given to them by the Exec based on their Loyalty to their boss (or the paycheck they sign for them). Loyalty is a shifting value; an Exec must (during every game session) do things to promote Loyalty and not lose it. **Loyalty caps at maximum of 10 between game sessions, but during an individual game session, Loyalty has no limit.**
#### Loyalty Save
When a task is given to a Team Member by the Exec, the GM must roll 1d6 under the Team member's current Loyalty. If the Save is failed, the Team Member may refuse or botch the assignment or otherwise turn on the Exec. If Loyalty drops to 0 or lower, the Team Member will actively attempt to betray the Exec to their enemies. If at the end of a session a Team Member has less than 0 Loyalty, they will complain to HR and either receive a transfer or quit upon having one refused, depending on HR's whims. Either way, they are gone. See Losing Team Members, just above.

### Creating Your Team Members
- **Job**: Decide what your Team Member's job is. If you want to, you can also pick a cover job for them as well. You might not want other people to know you've got a Covert Ops specialist or Netrunner on the payroll.
- **STATs**: Roll 1d6 and read across the corresponding row, recording each STAT. Don't forget to determine their HP, Mortally Wounded, and Death Save values. You do not need to lower their EMP due to Humanity Loss from cyberware. That's already been factored in.
- **Skills, Cyberware, and Gear**: Record your Team Member's Skills, Cyberware, and Gear. These are standard packages provided to them by the company.
- **Starting Loyalty**: Roll 1d6 and add 1. This is your Team Member's starting Loyalty.
