## Weapon Attachments
Each Non-Exotic Ranged Weapon has 3 Attachment Slots that can be upgraded with attachments. You can combine multiple attachments that take up the same physical location, but you must pay the slot cost of both attachments independently. Equipping the same attachment twice does nothing. Attachments are made for specific weapon types and cannot be easily retrofitted for other weapon types. 
### Bayonet
**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons fired with the Shoulder Arms Skill.
When wielded, this weapon can also be used as a Light Melee Weapon. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing.
### Extended Magazine
**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons except Bows/Crossbows.
The weapon holds a maximum number of shots equal to its Extended entry on the Clip Chart chart below. Only one clip can be attached to a weapon at a time. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing.
### Drum Magazine
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons except Bows/Crossbows.
The weapon holds a maximum number of shots equal to its Drum entry on the Clip Chart below. Only one clip can be attached to a weapon at a time. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing.
### Grenade Launcher Underbarrel
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons fired with the Shoulder Arms Skill.
When wielded in two hands, the weapon can also be used as a Grenade Launcher, with only 1 grenade in its magazine. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing. **Requires 2 Attachment Slots.** 
### Infrared Nightvision Scope
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.
Reduces penalties imposed on your firing at a target obscured to you by darkness, smoke, fog, etc. to 0. Looking through the scope, you can distinguish hot meat from cold metal, but not more specifically than that. You canâ€™t tell the brand of their Cyberarm from a distance, or see any of its internal surprises, for example.
### Shotgun Underbarrel
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons fired with the Shoulder Arms Skill.
When wielded in two hands, the weapon can also be used as a Shotgun, with only 2 shots in its magazine. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing. **Requires 2 Attachment Slots.**
### Smartgun Link
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.
Installing or uninstalling a Smartgun Link takes an hour. A weapon is a Smartgun only when it has a Smartgun Link attached to it. Special Cyberware is required to take advantage of a Smartgun. A Smartgun Link must be connected to you with Interface Plugs or a Subdermal Grip in order to operate, both of which require you to have a Neural Link. A Subdermal Grip connects a Smartgun held in it automatically. You can plug in Interface Plugs as part of drawing a Smartgun into a free hand, as long as your Interface Plugs aren't already plugged into something else. Being disarmed of your Smartgun doesn't snap your cables, it just unplugs them from the Smartgun. Plugging them back in isn't an Action should you have the Smartgun in your hand, as their ports are designed for ease-of-use. Why go through all this trouble? Because when making Ranged Attacks with one, you add a +1 to your Check. **Requires 2 Attachment Slots.**
### Sniping Scope
**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.
Looking through the scope, user can see detail up to 800m/yds away. When attacking a target 51m/yards
or further away with either a weapon's single shot firing mode or an Aimed Shot, you can add a +1 to your
Check. Does not stack with TeleOptics Cyberware.

### Basic Ammunition
>**Cost**: 10eb (Cheap) | **Ammo Types Available**: All except Grenades and Rockets

This is the standard ammunition for the weapon. It has no special features. 
### Armor-Piercing Ammunition
>**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Ammo Types Available**: All except Shotgun Shells

When using this ammunition, you ablate armor by 2 instead of 1 whenever you would ablate armor.
### Biotoxin Ammunition
>**Cost**: 10eb (Cheap) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows and Grenades Only

When using this ammunition, you deal no damage with your attack. Anyone meat hit by your attack must
instead attempt to beat a **DV15 Resist Torture/Drugs Check**. Anyone who fails is dealt 3d6 damage directly
to their HP. Their armor isn't ablated because it wasn't interacted with.
### EMP Ammunition
>**Cost**: 10eb (Cheap) | **Ammo Types Available**: Grenades Only

When using this ammunition, you deal no damage with your attack. Anyone hit by your attack must instead
attempt to beat a **DV15 Cybertech Check**. If they fail, the GM chooses 2 pieces of their Cyberware or carried
electronics to become inoperable for 1 minute. Cyberlimbs that are rendered inoperable act as their meat
counterparts do when they have been dismembered, but they still hang loosely.
### Expansive Ammunition
>**Cost**: 10eb (Cheap) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows, Bullets, and Slugs

When using this ammunition, whenever you cause the Foreign Object Critical Injury, the victim rolls again on
the [[Combat#Critical Injuries to the Body|Critical Injuries Table]]) until they roll a Critical Injury that isn't Foreign Object. The victim then suffers that Critical Injury as well. This second injury deals no Bonus Damage.
### Flashbang Ammunition
>**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Ammo Types Available**: Grenades Only

When using this ammunition, you deal no damage with your attack. Anyone hit by your attack must instead
attempt to beat a **DV15 Resist Torture/Drugs Check**. Anyone who fails suffers the Damaged Eye and
Damaged Ear Critical Injuries (see pg. 188) for the next minute. **You do not take the Bonus Damage from**
**the Critical Injuries**.
### Incendiary Ammunition
>**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows, Bullets, Grenades, and Shotgun Shells

When using this ammunition, whenever you deal damage to a target through their armor, you ignite the target.
Until your target spends an Action to put themselves out, they take **2 damage directly to their HP whenever**
**they end their Turn**. Multiple instances of this effect cannot stack.
### Poison Ammunition
>**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows and Grenades Only

When using this ammunition, you deal no damage with your attack. Anyone meat hit by your attack must
instead attempt to beat a **DV13 Resist Torture/Drugs Check**. Anyone who fails is dealt 2d6 damage directly
to their HP. Their armor isn't ablated because it wasn't interacted with.
### Rubber Ammunition
>**Cost**: 10eb (Cheap) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows, Bullets, and Slugs

Damage dealt using this ammunition cannot cause a Critical Injury. Additionally, attacks made with this
ammunition cannot ablate armor. If damage dealt by this ammunition would reduce a target with more than
1 HP to less than 0 HP, they are instead left at 1 HP.
### Sleep Ammunition
>**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows and Grenades

When using this ammunition, you deal no damage with your attack. Anyone meat hit by your attack must
instead attempt to beat a **DV13 Resist Torture/Drugs Check**. Anyone who fails is now [[Combat#Prone|Prone]]
and Unconscious for 1 minute or until they are woken by taking damage, or by someone else using an Action
that touches them.
### Smart Ammunition
>**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Ammo Types Available**: Arrows, Bullets, and Rockets

Targeting Scope Cyberware is required in order to make use of Smart Ammunition. When fired by a User
without Targeting Scope Cyberware, Smart Ammunition won't fire even when the trigger is pulled, as a safety
feature. When using this ammunition, whenever you miss a shot by 4 or less when using a weapon's single
shot firing mode, your missed shot immediately has a second chance to hit your target. This second chance
to hit is made by rolling again to hit the exact same shot DV on the range table which you missed, except that
you add 10 to the d10 instead of anything you would typically add to the Check, with the only exception
being LUCK. A target that can dodge bullets can choose to dodge this ranged attack as normal.
### Smoke Ammunition
>**Cost**: 50eb (Costly) | **Ammo Types Available**: Grenades Only

Obscures a 10m/yd by 10m/yd area with smoke for a minute on impact. The typical penalty for trying to
perform a task obscured by smoke is -4.
### Teargas Ammunition
>**Cost**: 50eb (Costly) | **Ammo Types Available**: Grenades Only

When using this ammunition, you deal no damage with your attack. Anyone with meat eyes hit by your attack
must instead attempt to beat a **DV13 Resist Torture/Drugs Check**. Anyone who fails suffers the Damaged Eye
[[Combat#Critical Injuries to the Head|Critical Injury]] Critical injury (see pg. 188) for the next minute. You do not take the Bonus Damage from the Critical Injury.
