## Weapon Attachments
Each Non-Exotic Ranged Weapon has 3 Attachment Slots that can be upgraded with attachments. You can combine multiple attachments that take up the same physical location, but you must pay the slot cost of both attachments independently. Equipping the same attachment twice does nothing. Attachments are made for specific weapon types and cannot be easily retrofitted for other weapon types. 
### Bayonet
**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons fired with the Shoulder Arms Skill.
When wielded, this weapon can also be used as a Light Melee Weapon. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing.
### Extended Magazine
**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons except Bows/Crossbows.
The weapon holds a maximum number of shots equal to its Extended entry on the Clip Chart chart below. Only one clip can be attached to a weapon at a time. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing.
### Drum Magazine
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons except Bows/Crossbows.
The weapon holds a maximum number of shots equal to its Drum entry on the Clip Chart below. Only one clip can be attached to a weapon at a time. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing.
### Grenade Launcher Underbarrel
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons fired with the Shoulder Arms Skill.
When wielded in two hands, the weapon can also be used as a Grenade Launcher, with only 1 grenade in its magazine. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing. **Requires 2 Attachment Slots.** 
### Infrared Nightvision Scope
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.
Reduces penalties imposed on your firing at a target obscured to you by darkness, smoke, fog, etc. to 0. Looking through the scope, you can distinguish hot meat from cold metal, but not more specifically than that. You canâ€™t tell the brand of their Cyberarm from a distance, or see any of its internal surprises, for example.
### Shotgun Underbarrel
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons fired with the Shoulder Arms Skill.
When wielded in two hands, the weapon can also be used as a Shotgun, with only 2 shots in its magazine. While this is attached to a weapon, it cannot be concealed under clothing. **Requires 2 Attachment Slots.**
### Smartgun Link
**Cost**: 500eb (Expensive) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.
Installing or uninstalling a Smartgun Link takes an hour. A weapon is a Smartgun only when it has a Smartgun Link attached to it. Special Cyberware is required to take advantage of a Smartgun. A Smartgun Link must be connected to you with Interface Plugs or a Subdermal Grip in order to operate, both of which require you to have a Neural Link. A Subdermal Grip connects a Smartgun held in it automatically. You can plug in Interface Plugs as part of drawing a Smartgun into a free hand, as long as your Interface Plugs aren't already plugged into something else. Being disarmed of your Smartgun doesn't snap your cables, it just unplugs them from the Smartgun. Plugging them back in isn't an Action should you have the Smartgun in your hand, as their ports are designed for ease-of-use. Why go through all this trouble? Because when making Ranged Attacks with one, you add a +1 to your Check. **Requires 2 Attachment Slots.**
### Sniping Scope
**Cost**: 100eb (Premium) | **Eligible**: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.
Looking through the scope, user can see detail up to 800m/yds away. When attacking a target 51m/yards
or further away with either a weapon's single shot firing mode or an Aimed Shot, you can add a +1 to your
Check. Does not stack with TeleOptics Cyberware.
