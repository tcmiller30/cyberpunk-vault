## Move Action
Every Turn, a Character gets a Move Action, which can only be used to move a number of m/yds equal to their MOVE x 2, or a number of squares (if playing on a grid) equal to their MOVE, which can include moving diagonally. If you are playing on a grid, you cannot stop in between the squares.
### Prone
When you are Prone, you can't use your Move Action until you use the Get Up Action
### Split Movement
When you move using your Move Action, you can split your Movement and use an Action in between. For example, you can use part of your Movement to move to a position, take an Action, and use the rest of your Movement afterwards.
### Rate of Fire (ROF)
Some types of attacks are faster than others and are capable of striking/shooting twice with a single attack action, called 2 Rate of Fire (ROF) Attacks. Like movement, all attacks from 2 ROF sources can also be split. You can move, shoot, move, shoot, move. **You can even make a single attack from each of two different 2 ROF sources by splitting your two attacks between the two of them**, allowing both to be used in a single turn. This allows you to use a **Heavy Pistol** in your off-hand and walk towards your target to finish them off with a **Machete** in your main-hand.

Attacks from 1 ROF Weapons are slower and take your whole Attack Action, but you can still split your movement around them.
### Other Forms of Movement
Swimming, Climbing, and Jumping with a running start all cost 2 m/yds of movement for every m/yd traveled or 2 squares for every 1 square. When jumping from standing you can clear half the distance that you could with a running start. See [[Combat#Taking Damage|Taking Damage]] for more on falling and drowning.

### Alternate Fire Modes/Special Features
#### Autofire
Being skilled at keeping an automatic gun on target allows you to bring out the best in Autofire.

When you use Autofire, it costs an Action and 10 bullets. **If you do not have 10 bullets left in your magazine, you cannot use Autofire**. You use the [[STATs and Skills#Autofire *x2* (REF)|Autofire]] Skill instead of the weapon's typical Weapon Skill.Additionally, instead of the weapon's entry on the Range Table, you use its entry on the Autofire Range Table. **Autofire cannot be used to make an Aimed Shot.**

| Weapon Type   | 0 to 6 m | 7 to 12 m | 13 to 25 m | 26 to 50 m | 51 to 100 m |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| SMGs          | 20       | 17        | 20         | 25         | 30          |
| Assault Rifle | 22       | 20        | 17         | 20         | 25          |

>[!callout]- Targets with REF 8 or Higher can still choose to attempt to dodge your Autofire.

**If you hit, roll 2d6 for damage, and multiply it by the amount you beat the DV to hit your target, up to a maximum denoted by the weapon's Autofire (3 for SMGS, 4 for Assault Rifles).** This is the amount of damage that Autofire dealt. If both dice came up 6, you've inflicted a Critical Injury
#### Arrows
Bows and Crossbows fire Arrows. Because loading an Arrow is part of attacking with a Bow or Crossbow, **you never need to Reload a Bow or Crossbow using the Reload Action**. Additionally, **Basic Arrows** can always be retrieved after they are fired, making buying basic ammunition for these weapons almost a one-time investment.
#### Suppressive Fire
When you use Suppressive Fire, it costs an Action and 10 Bullets. **If you don't have 10 Bullets remaining in your clip, you can't use Suppressive Fire**. 

Everyone on foot within 25 m/yds, out of cover, and in your line of sight must roll **WILL + Concentration + 1d10** against your **REF + Autofire Skill + 1d10**. 

Anyone that fails must use their next Move Action to get into cover. If that Move Action would be insufficient to get into cover, they must also use the Run Action to get into cover or as close to cover as possible.
#### Shotgun Shells

#### Explosives
## Avoiding Damage
### Taking Cover
>##### The Golden Rule of Cover
>**You are considered to be in cover if you are fully behind something that could stop a bullet.
>
>If they have line of sight on you, you aren't in cover.
>
>There is no "partial" cover. It can either stop a bullet or it can't. If it cannot stop a bullet, it provides no cover and thus has no HP.**

Another method to get somebody "out of cover" is to destroy the cover itself with a grenade or other destructive item. Anything that can be used as cover has HP, and a 2m by 2m section of it can be attacked the same as a Target. **At 0 HP, cover is destroyed**.

#### Cover Hit Points
Cover HP is determined by the material and its thickness

**Thin** cover might be able to be moved slightly in a pinch, but **Thick** cover is too unwieldy for Characters without a BODY 10 or higher to move without special equipment.

| Type of Cover        | Thick HP | Thin HP          |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Steel                | 50 HP    | 25 HP            |
| Stone                | 40 HP    | 20 HP            |
| Bulletproof Glass    | 30 HP    | 15 HP            |
| Concrete             | 25 HP    | 10 HP            |
| Wood                 | 20 HP    | 5 HP             |
| Plaster/Foam/Plastic | 15 HP    | 0 HP (Not Cover) |

### Using Shields
Equipping and dropping a shield takes an Action. While you are using a hand to carry a shield, it cannot be used to do anything else. A shield is a movable source of cover, and while you wield a shield with HP remaining, you are considered to be in cover. When attacked by a target that you can see, you can interpose the shield between yourself and the attack. If you choose to do so, you cannot dodge the attack at all, though a Ranged Attack can still miss you due to your opponent's poor marksmanship. The shield takes the entire attack to its HP.

**If a shield hits 0 HP it is destroyed (until repaired if inorganic), and cannot be used as cover, though it still remains equipped to your hand until you use and Action to drop it.**

| Shield Type        | Shield Description                                                        | Hit Points (HP)                  | Cost                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Bulletproof Shield | A transparent polycarbonate shield that can protect you from a firefight. | 10                               | 100eb (Premium)                              |
| Corpse             | Shield made of meat. Used to be a person                                  | BODY STAT the corpse had in life | Depends on how many bullets you went through |

#### Human Shields
**If you are already the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to "equip" the defender as a Human Shield** if you are not already wielding a shield, using the same hand you are using to Grapple them. While you wield a Human Shield, you are considered in cover. Human Shields are more unwieldy than typical shields. Because of their squirming, Human Shields cannot be used to block Melee Attacks, or Ranged Attacks specifically targeted at your head using an Aimed Shot. When attacked by a target that you can see with a Ranged Attack not targeted at your head, you can interpose the Human Shield between yourself and the Ranged Attack. **You can still attack your own Human Shield while you have them equipped**. Your Human Shield cannot dodge Ranged Attacks while you have them equipped, even if they have REF 8 or higher. When your Human Shield is shot, they take damage as if they had been shot normally. **A Human Shield who dies while you have them equipped automatically becomes a shield with HP equal to their BODY**. Unequipping a live Human Shield is as simple as ending your Grapple with them, which doesn't cost an Action, but dropping a corpse shield costs an Action just like any other shield.
### Wearing Armor
Armor is rated by its **Stopping Power (SP)**, which is how well it can stop incoming damage. It can be worn on either your body or your head, and it's advised you wear both.

Armor can be purchased for either the head or body locations. Wearing even a single piece of heavier armor will lower your REF, DEX, and MOVE by the most punishing Armor Penalty of armor you are wearing, a penalty which you only have to take once, even though you are likely wearing armor on both your body and head. This penalty can even leave your Character (if at MOVE 0) completely immobile. 

SP gained by armor does not "stack," only your highest source of SP in a location determines your SP for that location. **All your worn armor in a location is ablated simultaneously whenever you take damage.**

![[Weapons and Gear#Armor]]

## Wounding and Dying
### Taking Damage
Whenever you take damage:
>1. Your Attacker rolls the damage for their attack.
>2. Subtract your [[Weapons and Gear#Armor|armor's]] SP in that location (*if they didn't target your head using an Aimed Shot, this is always your body location*) from the damage. Subtract any remaining damage from your Hit Points
	>> - Some things that cause damage, like poison or fire, bypass armor
>3. If you ended up taking any damage, your armor on that location is still ablated, reducing its SP by 1 point, until it is repaired or destroyed

### Non-Combat Damage Sources
#### Burning
When you are On Fire, until you use an Action to put yourself out, you take an amount of damage direct to your HP at the end of your Turn. Your armor isn't ablated. Remember that each Turn is only three seconds. This adds up.

| Intensity | Example       | Effect                |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Mild      | Wood Fire     | 2 Direct Damage to HP |
| Strong    | Gasoline Fire | 4 Direct Damage to HP |
| Deadly    | Thermite      | 6 Direct Damage to HP |

#### Drowning/Asphyxiation
Characters can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to their BODY. When you can't hold your breath any longer, you start Drowning. At the beginning of a Turn where you are Drowning, you take your BODY STAT directly to your Hit Points in damage. This damage ignores your armor and doesn't ablate it.

Asphyxiation should be treated like Drowning, save that there are sometimes **secondary effects**. If you are **Asphyxiating in space** you will take an additional 1d6 in damage at the end of your Turn to your INT, REF, and DEX from exposure to the vacuum. If your INT reaches 0, you are dead. This damage to your STATs is reversed if you manage to get a breath of air.
#### Electrocution
**When you are electrocuted, you immedi- ately take 6d6 damage.** This damage is soaked by armor as normal. If you don't move away from the source of your electrocution, this damage repeats at the end of each of your Turns, starting with your next Turn.
#### Exposure
Prolonged exposure to the extreme elements will deal 1d6 damage directly to your HP at the end of each day of exposure. While exposed to the extreme elements, even if Stabilized, you cannot heal naturally. With proper equipment for your environment, you will never risk exposure.
#### Falling
Falling Characters fall 40m/yds at the end of their Turn. At the moment they are no longer on solid ground, if an edge or ledge is nearby, they get one attempt to save themselves from flight with a DV15 Athletics Check. No Check is required if you have a Grapple Hand, Grapple Gun, etc.

Upon hitting the ground, **Characters who fall 10 m/yds or more take 2d6 damage for every 10 m/yds they fell (soaked by body armor) and unless they then succeed a DV15 Athletics Check, also suffer the Broken Leg Critical Injury.** Characters with 2 Cyberlegs do not take this damage or suffer the Critical Injury. However, Cyberlegs do nothing to prevent damage or Critical Injury if the fall is greater than 30 m/yds. Common sense also dictates that if for some reason you fell off a skyscraper without a parachute, don't bother rolling a Death Save, you are dead.
#### Poisons and Drugs
When you are Poisoned or Drugged, you must make a Resist Torture/Drugs Check against the DV of the attack.
If you fail, you suffer the effect of the poison or drug. Your armor isn't ablated. Street drugs, their
effects, and addiction are described at length in the Trauma Team Section
#### Radiation
### Wound States
As you take damage, you cross Wound State Thresholds, eventually becoming wounded in ways that impair your performance. Each new Wound State replaces the effect of your previous Wound State.

**Your Wound State is determined by the amount of Hit Points you have remaining.**

| Wound State                  | Threshold                   | Wound Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Stabilization DV                                                                     |

### Critical Injuries
>##### Whenever two or more dice rolled for damage from a Melee or Ranged Attack come up 6, you've inflicted a Critical Injury. Roll 2d6 on the appropriate Critical Injury Table until you get a Critical Injury the Target is no currently suffering.

**All Critical Injuries cause a horrible Injury Effect and deal 5 Bonus Damage** directly to the targets Hit Points when suffered.

Critical Injuries and their bonus damage are inflicted regardless of if any of the attack's damage got through the target's SP.

### Mortally Wounded
Mortally Wounded Characters suffer a Critical Injury whenever they are damaged by an Attack. In addition
their Death Save Penalty increases by 1.
#### Death Saves
>##### **At the start of each of your Turns while you are Mortally Wounded, you must make a Death Save.** 

Roll a d10. If you roll under your BODY, you live, and can take your turn as usual. **If you roll a 10, you automatically fail your Death Save**. Every time you roll a Death Save, your Death Save Penalty increases, meaning each future Death Save you roll is made with an additional +1, making it progressively harder to stave off death. This Death Save Penalty continues to add up until you are brought back to 1HP by Stabilization, where it resets to your Base Death Save Penalty, which can be increased by the nastiest Critical Injuries.
>##### If you fail even a single Death Save, you die.
## Stabilization and Healing
The DV to stablilize a target (or yourself) depends on what Wound State your target is in.

>**Lightly Wounded: DV10
>Seriously Wounded: DV13
>Mortally Wounded: DV15**

Stabilization takes an Action and is rolled: TECH + **First Aid Skill** or **Paramedic Skill** + 1d10
### Post-Stabilization
Once successful stabilization has been reached, the target will heal a number of Hit Points equal to their BODY for each full day they spend resting, spending the majority of each day taking it easy and doing only light activity, until they are at Full HP again. If the patient pushes it, they will gain no HP that day, their wounds will reopen, and they will need to receive stabilization again to restart the natural healing process.
#### If Mortally Wounded
A Mortally Wounded target who receives successful stabilization is immediately healed to 1 Hit Point and is now Unconscious. Their adrenaline has run out. While unconscious, you are gone from the world. The condition always lasts 1 minute. You still roll Death Saves if somebody stabs you into a Mortally Wounded state while you are unconscious.
### Required Skills
There are 4 healing Skills in ***Cyberpunk Red***: **[[STATs and Skills#Cybertech (TECH)|Cybertech]], [[STATs and Skills#First Aid (TECH)|First Aid]], [[STATs and Skills#Paramedic *x2* (TECH)|Paramedic (x2)]],** and **[[#|Surgery]]**, a skill availble only through the Medtech Role Ability.
#### Cybertech
- Not capable of Stabilizing Wound States
- Can be used to Quick Fix and Treat Critical Injuries done to cyberware that have replaced meat parts like cyberlimbs or cybereyes.
#### First Aid
- Capable of Stabilizing Wound States and Quick Fixing only the most common Critical Injuries.
- Available to all Characters with minimal investment because it is always trained to at least +2
#### Paramedic (x2)
- Capable of Stabilizing Wound States and Quick Fixing or Treating all but the deadliest Critical Injuries. 
- Available to all Characters but is a costly investment as it is a (x2) cost Skill.
#### Surgery
- Capable of Treating even the deadliest Critical Injuries. 
- Available only to Medtechs through their Role Ability, Medicine
### Treating a Critical Injury
There are two ways to heal a Critical Injury: a **Quick Fix** and a **Treatment**. Depending on the severity of the Critical Injury, either option may not be available, or they may require different skills.
#### Quick Fix
>##### A Quick Fix will remove the Injury Effect for the rest of the day. Each attempt takes 1 minute. You can Quick Fix yourself.
#### Treatment
>##### A Treatment will remove the Injury permanently. Each attempt takes 4 hours. You cannot perform a Treatment on yourself.
## Vehicle Combat

### Structural Damage Points (SDP)
**All vehicles have Structural Damage Points (SDP).** As long as a vehicle has 1 SDP, it can move. When it is reduced to 0 SDP, it is destroyed, cannot be used as cover, and cannot move until repaired by an appropriate **Vehicle Tech Skill**.

**Vehicles cannot dodge Attacks like a human, but while in a vehicle you can still dodge anything that you could typically dodge on foot when it's targeted at you instead of the vehicle.** Shooting a vehicle with a ranged weapon still requires you to hit your shot using the range table.

**While in a vehicle, you can still be targeted with attacks through the glass, which has no HP and provides no cover.**

### Aiming For Vehicle Weak Points
**Every vehicle has weak points (tires, engine, gas cap, etc.), which can be aimed for using an *Aimed Shot***.

If the Aimed Shot is successful, multiply the damage that gets through the vehicle's SP by 2.
#### Ranged Aimed Shot
> ##### Attacker's REF + Relevant Weapon Skill + 1d10 - 8 (Aiming Penalty)
#### Melee Aimed Shot
There's no reason not to aim for a weak point with a melee weapon against a stationary vehicle because vehicles can't dodge and the attack automatically hits.

>##### Attacker's DEX + Relevant Weapon Skill + 1d10 - 8 (Aiming Penalty) vs. DV13 Against Moving Vehicle

### Starting a Vehicle
**When a Vehicle is started, three things happen:**
>1. The driver is placed immediately at the top of the Initiative Order
>2. The Vehicle's MOVE STAT effectively becomes the Driver's MOVE STAT. Any penalty the driver had to their MOVE doesn't affect the movement of the vehicle
>3. The driver becomes unable to use the Run Action

Getting into a vehicle is an Action, leaving a vehicle is not, just Movement. Starting and stopping a vehicle are both Actions. If you have *Interface Plugs*, part of this Action can include connecting/disconnecting them.**Using Interface Plugs to drive a vehicle means you can drive it with no hands.** Without the implant, one of your hands must be used for driving and can't be used to do anything else while you are driving. If you take this hand off the wheel, at the start of your next Turn you automatically Lose Control of the Vehicle

### Maneuvers
The GM will decide when any non-basic driving you want to do will require a Maneuver. Maneuvers require your full attention, which in game terms means both your Action and your Move Action. Failing to beat the DV of the Check with REF + Relevant Control Skill + 1d10 will cause you to immediately [[Combat#Losing Control of the Vehicle|Lose Control of the Vehicle]]. 

>**If screwing up couldn't cause you to lose control of the vehicle, it shouldn't require a Maneuver.**

>***Situations that require a Maneuver:***
> - **Swerve**: DV13
>- **Sharp Turn**: DV13
>- **Emergency Stop**: DV13
>- **Bootleg Turn**: DV17
>- **Do a Jump**: DV17
>- **Landing (Air Vehicle)**: DV13
>- **Aerobatic Maneuver (Air Vehicle)**: DV17
### Losing Control of the Vehicle
If you lose control of a vehicle, the GM determines your entire movement for the Turn you lose control. If your vehicle impacts something, it is treated as if you had rammed it.
### Ramming
Whenever you drive a vehicle into something with HP, be it a pedestrian, a piece of cover, or another vehicle, both your vehicle and the pedestrian, piece of cover, or other vehicle take 6d6 damage, and everyone involved in the crash (either as a pedestrian or a person in an involved vehicle) suffers the Whiplash Critical Injury.

If the HP of any piece of cover or other vehicle you are ramming becomes 0 due to this damage, your movement can continue. Otherwise, your vehicle's movement must stop. **You can always continue moving after you hit a pedestrian**, but if they have more than 0 HP after impact, they can choose to now be on top of your vehicle if they want.
#### Dodging a Ramming Vehicle
>##### On Foot: DEX + Evasion + 1d10 vs. DV13. If successful, the dodger can choose to be on top of the vehicle if they want.
### Basic Driving
Basic driving doesn't require a Skill Check if your REF + Relevant Control Skill is greater than 9. If yours isn't, basic driving requires you to use your Action every Turn to attempt a DV10 Check to maintain control of the vehicle using REF + Relevant Control Skill + 1d10. Failure means [[Combat#Losing Control of the Vehicle|Losing Control of the Vehicle]]. This is why you probably don't let your kid drive in the first place.

If your REF + Relevant Control Skill is greater than 9, Basic Driving doesn't require your Action, and operates just the same as taking a Move Action outside of a vehicle, except your MOVE is much higher while driving.
