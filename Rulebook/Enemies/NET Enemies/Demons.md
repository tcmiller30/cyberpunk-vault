In the Time of the Red, what we call Demons are actually very specific types of Black ICE Intelligent Systems. They are not the True AIs of the pre-War period, which were restricter after the destruction they wrought during the 4th Corporate War.

These "Demons" are designed to attack Meatspace targets, such as a Netrunner's support party, using Control Nodes, like drones and turrets.

Demons have an **Interface** and a **Combat Number**. This Combat Number combines both STAT and Skill for them. You add a d10 roll to this Combat Number for the purpose of attacking and defending with drones, turrets, etc., which they are Controlling. **They are unable to run Programs or Black ICE.**

With their Interface, Demons have access to only 2 Netrunner Abilities with which to use their NET Actions: Zap (to defend themselves) and Control (to operate Control Nodes). **Even when operated by a Demon, each Control Node can still only be activated once per Turn. Demons can have control of multiple Control Nodes just like Netrunners.**

A Demon is constantly aware of every facet of its Architecture, which means that it is unimpeded by Passwords, is always aware of any Netrunner's presence, and automatically wins any Speed contest against a Program.

Thus, Demons have no SPD or PER score. Because of this, you cannot Slide away from a Demon, and the Demon doesn't have a chance to get a free hit on you when it discovers you. Demons don't have DEF either, and defend just as a Netrunner does with Interface + 1d10.

**A Demon enters the Initiative Queue at the top when it detects an intruder with one of its Observation Cameras, or when a Netrunner enters its Architecture. On their Turn, Demons prioritize acting on Control Node triggers using their NET Actions, and only Zap an enemy Netrunner with their leftover NET Actions.**

The biggest limit of a Demon is its specific, non-vo- litional "intelligence." Demons are rather like the AI used in video games; they have "triggers" that set up predetermined actions they can take. 

For instance, a Demon controlling a turret knows to attack anyone who enters a specific room who is not wearing a specific ID badge. This is all it cares about. If the marketing manager's ID badge had been unknowingly replaced with the wrong ID, the Demon would treat them just like any other intruder.
