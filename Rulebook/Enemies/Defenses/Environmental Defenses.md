Environmental Defenses are systems that are "built into" a specific part of the everyday environment. They are usually spread over a limited space, such as a hallway, room, or relatively small enclosed/fenced space. Many of these are either part of the structure of the floors, walls, or ceilings, or have emitters/projectors built into those spaces. Environmental Defenses will each have their own Control Nodes in a NET Architecture. They are all automatic, and even when controlled by a Demon or a Netrunner can only be toggled ON or OFF, and always Activate exactly on their trigger. When a Demon isn't present, turning on the Electrical Flooring at night before they leave is somebody in the building's job. 

When an Environmental Defense isn't being controlled, it is vulnerable to being countered using the Electronics/ Security Tech Skill. Once countered, the Environmental Defense can be controlled remotely within 6m/yds of one of the NET Architecture's Access Points with an Agent using an Action in the same manner that a Netrunner does with their Interface Ability, Control.
