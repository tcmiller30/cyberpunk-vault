Emplaced Defenses are systems that are immobile and restricted to a single space or area. They are considered
"active" defenses in as much as their programming requires a set of predetermined conditions that then trigger
an attack. Each is connected to its own Control Node in a NET Architecture. Unlike Active Defenses, Emplaced
Defenses do not require a Demon or Netrunner to operate them. When acting on their own without being
controlled by a Demon, they use their Combat Number, which combines both STAT and Skill for them, to which
you add a 1d10. Emplaced defenses can't dodge attacks because they are stationary.
When an Emplaced Defense isn't being controlled, it is vulnerable to being countered using the Electronics/
Security Tech Skill. Once countered, the Emplaced Defense can be controlled remotely within 6m/yds of one of
the NET Architecture's Access Points with an Agent using an Action in the same manner that a Netrunner does
with their Interface Ability, Control.
When controlled by a Netrunner, all attacks are made using the Netrunner's own Skills as if they were firing
its weapons in their own hands.
