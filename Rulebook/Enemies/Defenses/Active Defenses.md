Active Defenses are small robots capable of independent action within an area. Like autonomous vehicles,
they can follow a target over a long distance, usually up to the perimeter of the defended site, such as a
building or a fenced/enclosed area. **Unless they are being controlled manually by a Netrunner,**
**Active Defenses require a Demon controlling their Control Node in the Architecture to stay**
**operational.**

When an Active Defense isn't being controlled, it is vulnerable to being countered using the Electronics/
Security Tech Skill. Once countered, the Active Defense can be controlled remotely within 6m/yds of one of
the NET Architecture's access points with an Agent using an Action in the same manner that a Netrunner does
with their Interface Ability, Control.

When controlled by a Netrunner, all attacks and defenses are made using the Netrunner's own Skills as if
they were firing its weapons in their own hands and dodging with their own body.
