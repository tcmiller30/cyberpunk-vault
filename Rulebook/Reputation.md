*Another Kind of Combat*

Not everything on The Street is determined with fists or guns. In a world where combat can end your life in a hot nanosecond, other methods have evolved to determine who is going to be the top dog in a conflict. One of these methods involves having a Reputation. 

Reputation is a measure of things your Character may do so well (or so badly) that they become well known for them. A Reputation for something is always established by a Character's actions, and is then awarded by the GM. **When your GM believes your Character has done something worthy gaining a Reputation, they can assign them a Reputation Level from the table below.** This is your Character's Reputation. While people may know of the other less impressive deeds your Character has accomplished, a new deed's Reputation will only replace the old one if the Level is higher.

## Facedowns
Reputation in Cyberpunk RED has one other big effect: Facedowns. A lot of combat in Cyberpunk RED comes down to a duel of willsâ€”who's tougher, meaner, and looks more ready to prove it. This often leads to what are called Facedowns, when two heavies on The Street square off just before a fight or to see who'll back down from a confrontation. 

### Facedown Roll
> ##### Both Participants roll: COOL + REPUTATION + 1d10
> ###### If your defining Reputation Event is for cowardice your Reputation Level is treated as a negative number
